The Best of Soccer Journal: Techniques & Tactics

Warm-up exercises
Coaches should be careful during the warm-up phase of practices
that players begin with passes that are somewhat shorter than the
length of passes that will occur during the concluding warm-up
activities. Be certain that your players are warmed up properly and
are stretched sufficiently to prevent injury.

Exercise 1
Short, short, long passing in groups of five. Begin with players in a
30 x 30-yard space and expand as needed (Diagram # 1). Player
receiving the long pass should take a controlling touch and dribble
the ball a few times. Then passes begin again – short, short, long.
The long pass should be made to the player farthest from the passer
as other players run to support the player receiving the long pass.
Keep the ball moving, using the central players as obstacles to play
around or over.

- Add a wall-pass upon reception of the long pass (Diagram # 1A).
- Add a double pass upon reception of the long pass.
- Add takeover upon reception of the long pass.

    pointed up, strike ball with ankle bone; ankle
    locked; contact ball with inside of ankle bone;
    contact ball with inside of foot
- Top of foot: strike ball with the top of the foot
- Outside of foot: toes are pointed down, support
    foot is slightly behind the ball, strike the ball
    with the outside of the foot
- Follow through the ball toward the target –
    transfer the weight forward; speed of foot
    through the ball; follow through quickly; follow
    through with the hips toward the target

    - Speed – Close space to attacker quickly,
       lowering center of gravity
    - Angle – Bend run as defender approaches
       the attacker to the right or the left so that
       the body is positioned side on (one foot in
       front of the other foot)
- Action: Eyes on ball and shuffle feet backwards
    at an angle forcing attacker to a covering
    defender, the touch line or the goal line

       recover if the poke is missed), poke at an angle
    - With back to goal – moving backwards
       with shuffle steps, use feints
          - Side to Side with Attacker – run level with
             attacker and poke the ball when it is in the
             middle of the attacker or closer to the defender
          _Block Tackle – With the Back Foot_
          - Step forward with the weight low next to
             the ball with the back foot, tackle with

## Good Technique Is Not Enough

Lang Wedemeyer
NSCAA Academy Staff

O

n several occasions, I have heard former U.S.
National Team coaches Bruce Arena and
April Heinrichs mention that one of the biggest
problems with our rising youth players, boys and
girls alike, is that they do not have the ability
to play effectively under pressure. The players’
technique breaks down when under pressure and
their speed of play is not fast nor accurate enough
to create a flow in high-level games. This raises
a question: “What is the youth coach’s role and
responsibility in teaching technique that leads to
better speed of play and the development of more
creative and skillful players?”

We constantly preach “technique, technique,
technique” to our younger players, but are coaches
truly helping them develop efficient technique
under pressure? Or are we constantly setting up
unrealistic situations for them?

Take for example the “Coerver Craze.” Fast footwork
is wonderful; I do it with my players all the time.
But what are the situations in which coaches
are training their players to use these technical
skills? Are we having them make moves against
phantom defenders? What happens when they are
faced with a real live defender coming at them at
different speeds or different angles or in different
parts of the field? Are we doing enough to help
prepare and develop our players to deal with
these types of situations? Often, we are left with
technical repetition without tactical context.

What is the coach’s responsibility in relation to
training technique? The responsibility is three-
pronged:

- Giving the players tools with which to practice
    on their own
       - Repetitively putting players in a pressured
          environment in training sessions, and
       - Emphasizing the important coaching points
          during the games.

Defining technique and skill

Technique is the mechanism with which the
body maneuvers itself to be able to complete an
objective. If the objective is to pass the ball 15
yards to a teammate, the brain informs the body
to maneuver itself in order to kick the ball in
that direction. How well the body adjusts to the
demand determines how good the technique is,
while how quickly the brain interprets the cues and
the message sent to the muscles determines the
speed of play. The better the technique, the greater
the likelihood that the ball will go where we want it
and how we want it played.

Then what is the difference between technique and
skill? As taught to me by the late Mike Berticelli
(former Director of Coaching on the NSCAA) in
my first NSCAA National Course, technique is the
mechanics behind solving a problem, and skill is
being able to solve the problem regardless of the
mechanics. Skill is basically getting the job done no
matter how it looks. But with better technique, the
player’s success rate is heightened.

In the early stages of the coaching schools, we
teach youth coaches about progression in their
training sessions. The first progression in a
technical session is referred to as fundamental.
This is placing players in an environment in which
they are receiving lots of repetitions without initial
pressure. Then pressure is added progressively,

judging by the success rate of the players. Most
coaches still organize technical training based
on this format. What I am proposing is using
these ideas to help players start to practice on
their own outside of the team training sessions.
Youth coaches need to instruct players on how to
effectively self-train. Most coaches give our youth
players “homework” to practice between training
sessions, and that is a good start. The problem is
how to get these players to really self-train when
there are so many other things that they want to
be doing. Coaches have to compete with Nintendo,
birthday parties, other sports, watching TV – the
list goes on and on. The only real way that I see is
to continually stress the importance of ball work
to the players and their parents. The ones who are
practicing on their own will naturally be the more
motivated and usually emerge as the best players
as they develop at a faster rate.

The rest are the players whom coaches have to
motivate in terms of self-development. There is an
unlimited number of exercises that coaches can give
their players to practice on their own – everything
from the Coerver techniques to passing against a
wall to juggling, etc. But there is still a problem.
Tom Turner, Region II DOC, talks about a girl at
one of the regional camps who had unbelievable
technical ability. This youth player could juggle
forever and do Coerver moves faster than anyone
in camp, but was lost and ineffectual on the field.
Here is where the role of the coach must emerge
to place these players in environments where their
technical ability is under pressure. If they are
successful in a more challenging environment, they
will turn each technique into skillful play.

Evaluating technical progress

How do coaches evaluate players’ technical
progress? The coach could test them with how
many Coerver moves they execute in a minute,
how many juggles in two minutes, how many
correct receptions out of 10 tosses, etc. But that all

takes too much practice time, though such testing
might be a worthy self-testing mechanism for off-
field work. Such testing is quantitative as opposed
to qualitative.

The coach’s responsibility is to create the
environment in which players are placed under
immediate pressure. The role of the coach is to help
players understand the cues that allow them to
apply proper technique in game-like situations. We
always hear there are no tactics without technique.
Well, there is no technique without tactics. The
use of the proper technique comes from decision-
making ability in pressure situations. This will help
the speed of play while also enforcing a higher
level of technical ability, but all within the context
of the game.

A sample practice

An example of this would be if a coach has a group
of U-10s and wants to improve their passing ability.
If the coach teaches them early on in the season
how to practice passing on their own, then come
practice time they shouldn’t have to be lined up
to practice that technique. Perhaps the warm-up
might have some small group line drills (passing
back and forth and exchanging line positions, etc.)
but the session could move right into a 5 v. 2 game
for warm-up where they are passing under some
type of initial pressure.

In this situation the coach can now help players
with understanding, of the technical nuances of
the weight of pass, deception, etc., which are all
decisions that lead to the success of the technique
of passing.

This must progress into a more game-like situation
in which there is free movement and free decision-
making on the part of the players. The technical
aspects of passing along with the cues that lead
to the use of those techniques would then be
continually emphasized throughout the session.


_Good Technique Is Not Enough_

_Techniques  Tactics 17_

A key point here is to still keep the numbers small,
especially with younger players. In situations where
they are placed in two goal games of 4v4, players
can’t hide and are forced into pressure situations
more often. So now we are getting the repetition
of using the different techniques over and over.
The players are also in an environment in which
they are constantly making the choices based on
cues from the game. This must be progressed into a
bigger game, depending on the age group, so that
more technical abilities come into play, such as
long passes, crosses, etc.

Playing the game

But what do coaches do when it’s game time?
For younger players, U-12 and down, it is a good
idea to set different goals for their games instead
of winning and scoring. Set goals of completed
passes in a row or everyone using the outside of

the foot to pass the ball at least once or everyone
chipping the ball at least once during the course
of the game, etc. In setting these goals, coaches
can emphasize the use of techniques in the game
atmosphere. When the technique breaks down for
a player, the coach can then make the decision
whether it was a simple mechanical mistake or the
decision to use that technique was not the right
one for that situation. Hopefully the player has
already determined what the problem was.

It is in the game environment, where players
are under the most pressure to perform, that
coaches can evaluate how well their training
regimen. has prepared them. When evaluating their
performance, the coach should make some notes
on different situations that can be recreated in a
training environment to help prepare the players to
understand the technical cues. An example would
be if the coach has been emphasizing passing in
the team’s training sessions for a period of time,

but realizes that the team is weak on shooting
the ball, then shooting might be the focus of
subsequent training sessions.

Problem solving

Having reviewed technical training methodology,
we are still faced with two real problems:

- How do we get our players to practice and
    improve their technical ability so they are
    proficient enough to place them into games?
- How do we as coaches learn and understand
    how to give our players the proper combination
    of technique with tactics?

There are different ways of answering both these
questions. The first one is up to the individual
coach. Only you as the coach can determine what
will inspire your players to go out and practice on
their own. Maybe you have them keep a juggling
record or rewards system for younger players or
give homework sheets to the parents. But all in all,
it will be the more inspired and dedicated players
(even at that age) who want to practice on their
own, who want to become better. The ultimate test
is how they perform in the game under pressure.
As these players progress, it will more than likely
be the motivated players who will develop the
fastest and go on to higher levels of soccer. Your
job with these youth players is to try and inspire
all of them, but also to nurture the ones who really
have the desire.

As for the second question, if you are reading this
article, then you are the kind of coach who will
also learn on his/her own. You have taken a big
step by just being a member of the NSCAA and
reading the magazine. Another way is by attending
coaching courses.

Also watching and evaluating games at every level
as often as possible is a great way to enhance your
knowledge. By watching an MLS or WUSA game

on television, one can learn how and why players
succeed by using their technical abilities. The coach
must also watch other games at or just above his/
her own coaching level to see how other players
handle speed of play issues. This is not only for the
coach. The players can also learn a lot by watching
other players or by trying to emulate them.

Conclusion

The teaching of technique is very important. But
technique without game application is worthless.
Players must have the ability to match technique
with tactics to be more successful in the game. A
player who can juggle 3,000 times is not effective
if the individual doesn’t have an impact on the
game. It is up to the youth coaches to help inspire
players to work on the fundamentals of soccer
outside of regular team training sessions. It is
also important for the coach to create a training
environment where the repetition of application of
technique is taught within the context of game-like
situations. Having said all of this, players should
always be encouraged to collectively play on their
own. It is within the game that they learn the most.

“Creative, skillful players will develop in response
to an environment where techniques and tactical
awareness develop together,” Tom Turner says.
Wouldn’t it be much nicer to coach players in the
game as opposed to constantly setting up stagnant
drills, not to mention more fun for the players?
By expanding time spent by the players training
technique on their own, coaches have a better
chance to achieve this ideal.

## Teaching Technique Tactically

Mark Nicole

M

ost would agree the modern game
continues to evolve into one of increased
speed of play in attack, immediate transition both
ways, and the pressure of playing efficiently in
decreased space with less time. As a consequence,
much higher levels of competence are being
expected of players as individuals and as a
collective unit. These levels are of course technical
and tactical in nature as well as extremely
demanding psychologically and physically. Youth
training sessions must now incorporate less
exclusive teaching of technique in preparation
for this phenomenon. The “drilling” of technique
without adding difficulty and pressure is myopic.
What is taught must be match related to effect
a more complete personnel development of the
young player. This is not to profess that practicing
a specific technique in isolation outside of the
moving game is counterproductive. This type of
training is of course necessary but should be made
more realistic as soon as possible

The Challenge

The challenge now becomes how to effectively
present, demonstrate, and teach “advanced
technical training” topics within a format that
incorporates other facets of the game. To succeed,
training must be stimulating for the players,
manageable for the coach and relevant to the
match. For example, basic concepts, such as looking
up field to play an early pass forward to feet and
striking the ball with the instep, must be taught
simultaneously. The technical ability becomes an
acquired skill enabling the player to solve tactical
soccer problems more efficiently which in turn will
ease to some degree the psychological burden
developing players are confronted with. Individual

confidence and composure on the ball will manifest
into collective cohesiveness of the group. Through
this cycle, players will continue to influence one
another in a self-directed, player-coaching-player
environment. This facilitates personnel growth
within the team structure increasing the probability
of the individual reaching their full potential as a
soccer player. Over time, this culture becomes the
accepted norm and each player benefits immensely
from the combined experience. The message here
is training must incorporate both technical and
tactical areas of focus in concert with one another.
If structured correctly, this vision can be offered to
players at an early age.

Small-Sided Tactical Games

To institute this type of mindset, it is important to
illustrate the differential between two commonly
used terms and approaches, these being “tactics”
and “small sided games.” Team tactics are the
framework by which the collective group attack
and defend in specific situations and locations
on the field. Playing direct versus the patience of
the counterattacking team is a pertinent example.
This type of knowledge at this level should be
discussed and demonstrated as briefly as possible
to orientate the group to operate within a few
general guidelines setting the stage for the more
important matter of teaching individual tactics.
Learning to understand the problems and solutions
of playing out of pressure near the touchline
against even numbers is vastly more important at
this stage than to understand that the game plan
is to stroke a long flighted ball from defending
third to attacking third and chase. There must be
a separation of learning how to win games versus
how to play the game correctly from an early age.


_20 The Best of Soccer Journal_

A small sided game played without a specific
technical and tactical focus becomes an exercise
in playing a game to justify its own title. Without
specified and understandable teaching topics,
what is there to be learned? A more directed
methodology would be the utilization of training
games to elicit the desired behavior from the
players, again as individuals and collectively.
Various tactical elements can be identified and
presented in a forum that provides the trainer
with a plethora of teaching opportunities. The
proximity and small numbers assure that all will
see and hear. There are also ample chances to
repeat positive and correct match-related solutions
in the correct sized area of the field where the
training topic occurs. It then becomes important
to relate the issues learned back to the general
team-playing guidelines. Within this framework,
the players become stimulated and in turn have
the confidence to experiment and partake in
alternative solutions to the problem to be solved.
The willingness to fearlessly take risk in the attack
is a prime and desirable example of a player who
has the confidence to deal with the challenges of
the situation. The individuals grow self-assured and
more mature, freeing themselves to experiment
with new self-taught solutions.

Practice Design

The crux of all this lies hidden within the ability of
the trainer to design sessions that continually teach
and recreate an identifiable technical and tactical
topic utilizing small player numbers. Building to
a team versus team training game on full goals is
the objective. This should be considered a worthy
endeavor that will indeed take considerable time
and patience from all participants involved. Over
time, a multitude of rewards will become apparent
to the teacher and the tasks required to enjoy them
will be vastly outweighed by the pleasure of the
experience. The following example of teaching
dribbling with a tactical twist is but one example
of the aforementioned training concept. For the

purpose of this series of articles, it has been
assumed that the players are somewhat “free of the
ball” and have acquired a level of skill that allows
them to perform technically while moving.

TOPIC: Attacking 1v1 with
the Dribble

Objectives:

Technical: Change dribbling direction.
Tactical: Change of pace during move.

Teaching Points:

- Sharp cuts with the ball.
- Drive defender one direction, attack opposite.
- Once past, cut into the defenders running path.

Organization:

Players: 12 players
Gear: 16 cones, spare balls
Field: 10 yards x 20 yards with a four-yard middle
zone (two fields)
Time: 40 minutes

_Teaching Technique Tactically_

_Techniques  Tactics 21_

Instructions:

There are six players on each field. A defender
is positioned in the middle zone and may not
chase attackers out of it. The other five attacking
players are split at each end of the field. To begin,
defenders must hold their hands behind their back.
Upon winning a ball, the defender dribbles out of
the zone and passes to a player on the end. The
ball loser becomes the defender. If the attacker
beats the defender, a pass is made to the end and
that player attacks the defender. The game should
be high tempo.

Progression:

Next, the middle defender then plays completely
live. Players score one point for each defender
beaten. The games are five minutes long. The player
on each field with the most points at time wins.

Progression:

Thirdly, when the middle defender is beaten, a
second defender steps onto the field from the
opposite end line. The attacker attempts to beat
the second defender over the end line. If the
second defender wins the ball, the middle zone is

attacked. The original attacker may chase until the
player reaches the middle zone. If the player gets
past the middle defender, a third defender will step
onto the field on the opposite end. The scoring is
the same.

Organization:

Players: 6v6 with two goalkeepers
Gear: 6 vests, 8 cones, 2 goals
Field: 60 yards, two goal areas and a middle zone,
field box width (44 yards)
Time: five 10-minute games

Instructions:

There are two teams of six players. One player from
each team is positioned in the defensive zone in
front of their own goal. The other 10 players begin
in the middle zone. The players in the middle must
defend in front of their defensive line on the field
and may not chase attackers in. Players, as an
initial restriction, may not pass the ball forward.

The ball must be dribbled into the attacking zone,
not passed. The dribbler takes the lone defender
on and attempts to score then rejoins the middle
group at the end of the play. If the defender wins,
the ball is dribbled free back to the middle to

restart game. A teammate will then become the
new single defender.

Progression:

- The individual beaten in the middle zone may
    chase the dribbler into the box;
- Then the teams may now chase into the
    attacking zone after the ball has been dribbled

in, though no goal can be scored unless a
defender is beaten off the dribble;

- Play full field with the restriction that no
    forward passes are allowed by either team.
    Coach looks for opportunities to reinforce both
    positive and negative individual dribbling

## Developing Speed of Play

Gary R. Allen
U.S. Youth Soccer National Staff

I

n the post-2010 World Cup game between the
United States and Brazil, I was struck by the
fact that the Brazilians, using many young players,
seemed to move at a much different pace than
the presumably more experienced Americans. The
Brazilian players moved the ball in and out of
space with pace and fluidity, often leaving U.S.
players stranded in unfortunate positions as they
hopelessly chased the ball. The Brazilians were not
physically faster than the U.S. players. Something
much more subtle occurred.

Throughout the World Cup, and in this game
with Brazil, the speed of the U.S. team appeared
to be one-dimensional. It was a “fight back hard”
unFeintingd full-speed-ahead type of effort.
This embodies the American spirit and it is an
attribute that has no parallel elsewhere. It served
us well against mainly physical teams like England,
Slovenia and Ghana. However, the limits of its
effectiveness were evident against the guile and
intelligent play of Brazil. While this attribute is
emblematic of our culture, its predominance to our
detriment also is a direct result of our youth soccer
programs, which I will discuss later.

Our coaching education programs also have
contributed to our lack of development of speed.
They have focused primarily on general concepts
of speed of play , broadly addressing the areas of
technical, tactical and physical speed. This analysis,
however, has overlooked how different kinds of
speed are developed and nurtured from the earliest
stages. U.S. Youth Soccer, through the work of Drs.
Tom Fleck, Ron Quinn, Dave Carr and others, has
begun to apply educationally grounded concepts
of learning by focusing on how players at different
ages develop cognitively, socially and physically.

These concepts concern the process of learning,
an indispensible ingredient to developing speed
of play. Unfortunately, many involved with youth
soccer in the United States only pay lip service to
these new considerations. A disconnect still exists
in our recognition of how the nature of the game
and the process of learning work together in the
development of speed of play.

The Game Defines Speed

Soccer truly is the only team sport that reflects
the culture of its players. The game is free flowing,
presents myriads of situations and involves constant
changes that require the players themselves to
individually and collectively solve problems in
spontaneous and natural ways. The problem-
solving nature of the game makes the concept of
“speed of play” much more multi-dimensional than
our current coaching schemes allow. Sports trainer
and author Vern Gambetta has defined different
types of speed in sport. These concepts have been
applied to soccer by Drs. Don Kirkendall and Joe
Luxbacher. (See Dr. Kirkendall’s March 8, 2002,
article in Active.com.) In addition to physical speed,
they have described such aspects as speed of
perception, anticipation, reaction, decision-making,
and speed on and away from the ball.

These aspects of speed make perfect sense when
we consider discussions about Pelé or other great
players. In addition to recognizing their superior
technical ability, descriptions of them often focus
on their ability to see two plays ahead or having
eyes in the back of their heads. They always appear
to think and act more quickly than those around
them. These descriptions concern their perceptual,


_24 The Best of Soccer Journal_

anticipatory and decision-making speed, as
well as speed away from the ball. There also is
another component to speed of play that few
have recognized: that of slowing down opponents’
perception, anticipation, reaction and other speeds.
The way players use the ball, the runs they make,
as well as body and head fakes, all play a part in
speeding up play by slowing opponents down. And
slowing opponents down is a crucial part of speed
at the highest levels of play.

In the youth game, our quest to produce more
efficient play from an adult’s perspective has
focused on physical speed, stifling the development
of other types of speed. We have paid little attention
to the fact that it is only through play and the
seemingly inefficient process of experimentation
that players can develop these other areas of
speed. Currently, we try to fit our young players into
our adult perception of what soccer should look
like to win particular games rather than provide
training and game environments that require,
encourage and allow the young players to think,
act – and yes, make mistakes – for themselves, as
the “culture” of their particular age group dictates.

Most youth soccer programs, from early ages,
are driven by adults who measure success by
the creation and development of teams that will
accumulate trophies and achieve results at each
age group level. Our young players never really are
given opportunities to think, act and experiment
for themselves. We have subordinated the process
of learning to results that can be measured by
objective adult standards.

Our Concept of Speed Is
Too Confined

The development of the organized youth soccer
programs in the United States has no parallel
anywhere else in the world. Although the British
and Europeans have begun their Academy and
other youth programs, they are all extensions

of their professional leagues. At their core are
financial considerations. Although some of the
latest iterations of the Academy programs in the
United States are based in MLS clubs for the
same reason, the structures for organized youth
development here commenced in the 1970s
outside the professional leagues and school-based
programs and have grown tremendously over the
past 40 years.

Currently, because of our concern for results, our
developmental programs focus on athletic prowess
and physical speed. This has led us to search for
elite players to create elite teams from eight years
old on. We have mistakenly considered physical
precociousness to be an accurate indicator of
future success. We have compounded the problem
by segregating these players from those less
precocious to form elite teams. The team is the
focal point, rather than the players. The success
of the team governs, and because games are
won mainly through athleticism, speed of play
is almost exclusively defined in physical terms.
Furthermore, players at these ages generally lack
the ability to think abstractly; therefore, the central
tactic is direct play, i.e., playing a ball into empty
areas of the field for players of both sides to
engage in a footrace.

Because we select the biggest, fastest and
strongest youth for our elite youth teams, this tactic
(read problem-solving) predominates throughout
our youth players’ formative and teenage years.

This stress on physical speed has had extremely
detrimental effects on the development of
technical speed in our young players. We have
selected younger and younger players based upon
their physical development; we have cast them in
specific roles that reward speed at the expense of
tight technical play. This system has deprived our
young players of many opportunities to experience
the process of using multi-faceted technical skills
in different situations and areas of the field.
To compensate technically, we have tried many


_Developing Speed of Play_

_Techniques  Tactics 25_

programs (such as the Coerver Method) that seek to
isolate the development of technical speed outside
the game itself. Unfortunately, these programs
treat technique outside the crucible of the game.
But technical speed involves types of speed that
can occur only in the game (such as perceptual
speed, anticipatory speed, reaction speed, decision-
making speed and speed without the ball).

These can be nurtured and developed only through
the process of being in situations presented by
the game itself. Furthermore, players must be
allowed to solve problems for themselves through
experimentation and failure, concepts that are
anathema to result-oriented adults.

Our primary focus on discovering and developing
the _elite_ player at younger and younger ages also
ignores all of the prevailing educational expertise
concerning how people learn and develop mentally,
physically and socially. Instead of allowing the
natural process of development to occur, we have
all but extinguished it. There are numerous articles
on this topic, so I will not repeat those points here,
but here is one example of our skewed focus: the
glaring contrast between initiating programs for
discovering _elite_ players versus our attempts to
have small-sided youth games.

Despite the strong evidence that early
identification is not reliable, in the space of 30
years we routinely have developed local, state
and national programs for Olympic Development,
the Super-Y Leagues, U.S. Club Leagues, USYSA
Regional Leagues and now Academy teams and
leagues for younger and younger _elite_ players.
In contrast, it took 15 years of debate to even
begin small-sided play for younger players, then
only sporadically and on a graduated basis over
a number of years throughout the country. Yet
the tremendous benefits of small-sided play were
made obvious by the dramatic increase in our level
of play in the 1994 World Cup. For the four years
preceding that Cup, the U.S. team trained almost
exclusively using small-sided play.

We Have the Framework,
but Not the Art

In all earnestness, we have perceived a problem,
sought to define it in terms we understand and
overcome it through planning. In so doing with
our youth programs, we have created an intricate
framework for youth play. Unfortunately, we have
tried to fit the players into the framework rather
than adjust the framework to fit the evolving needs
of the players.

Similarly, our coaching education system has
focused on the structures of activities and tools for
imparting information to players. Like our youth
programs, we have created a skeleton that does
little more than state that “the game is the best
teacher” and only generally defines principles of
play. The system does not provide much substance
as to what to see in the run of play or how
to use the structure of activities to develop the
game’s principles in a cohesive fashion. The system
sporadically addresses some of the aspects of
speed in isolated technical and tactical areas, but
there has been no concerted nor cohesive effort
to teach coaches how to incorporate them in every
facet of play.

Over the years, many have opined that if we
could just be like Brazil, we would succeed.
Unfortunately, these critics do little more than
cite Brazil’s “creativity” as the answer. Beyond
describing the cultural influences that cause these
traits, few have analyzed how Brazilians use each
of the aspects of speed of play, individually and
collectively. When they compare the United States
with Brazil, they liken the U.S. status as the framing
studs of a building, stating that it needs windows,
walls, doors and architectural design, but provide
no guidance as to how to obtain these things.

Despite the limited scope of the criticism, it does
have some value. It recognizes that the United
States is stuck at the framework stage. We need to
take the next step and focus on how our coaching


_26 The Best of Soccer Journal_

education program can positively affect our speed
of play. We can use the framework of activities
and “toolkits” the coaching school curriculum
currently provides to teach coaches how to recognize
opportunities for developing speed. We can put
flesh onto the bones of the framework of training
sessions by seeking to provide coaches with a better
understanding of the various components of speed
and how to recognize and nurture them within
training activities. For example, how and where a

first touch can speed up our play and slow down
opponents, different ways to use the ball (the fastest
thing on the field) as a decoy and to slow opponents
down, how and when to use width and depth to
create spaces between opponents, how and when
to run to see more of the field more quickly, how
and when to use different combinations between
players. These are just a few examples that I will
address in the second part of this article.

Soccer Speed, Like Art,
Requires Developing Its Many
Aspects Together

The aspects of speed of play are not isolated
concepts. They define and are defined by the
environment in which our young players play. They
also are achieved only through the process of play
and experimentation. In essence, the process is
the end. For us to develop players who can play
with multi-dimensional quickness, we must focus
more on the process for each player rather than on
creating tiers of result-seeking teams at younger
and younger ages.

It is like creating a painting in black and white
without using any other colors. Although it may be
art, it has certain limitations. The different kinds of
speed listed above are like different colors of paint
that an artist can use to create a more vivid work
of art. By themselves on the palette, they are mere
globs of paint, but when they are mixed and used
in various ways by a skillful artist, they can become
inspiring images. It is only through the mixing and
experimentation by an inspired artist that true art
is produced. We, the coaches, are not the artists!
The players are the artists, and it is they who must
learn the craft of playing. Our role should be to
provide the problems to solve with playing and
training environments (the canvas) that foster the
process of learning – the mixing, experimentation
and inspiration of the players themselves. Thus our
aim, especially before the age of 14, should be to
provide as many of these opportunities for as many

_Developing Speed of Play_

_Techniques  Tactics 27_

players as possible, not artificially create more elite
teams for fewer and fewer with an immediate focus
on winning.

The Game of and by the Players

Themselves Is the Best Teacher

Most of the different aspects to speed listed above
relate to speed of vision, thought and decision-
making. These are concepts that require much more
than mere repetition in controlled environments.
Furthermore, they do not concern only individual
speed, but that of the collective group. Since high-
level play requires the development of all of these
types of speed together, our training environments
must incorporate all of them in less contrived
and dictatorial ways. The players’ perceptions,
decisions, anticipation, reactions, etc., must be in
response to the problems the game itself presents.
We are seeking “game speed,” not just the ability
to succeed in an exercise. Furthermore, while
we create problem-solving environments in our
training sessions, we must allow players to solve
the problems presented.

Players also must be given time and opportunities
to play in small-sided situations with and against
players of different abilities. These types of games
provide increased numbers of touches, increased
opportunities for decisions on both sides of the
ball and do not reward physical speed as much as
larger-sided games. Furthermore, playing with and
against many different caliber and types of players
requires each player to adjust and make differing
decisions as to how to compete individually and in
groups. It is the process of making these differing
decisions that _is the process_ of developing speed.

Emphasis on Speed of Play

Speed of play should be a continuous touchstone
for all youth coaches, yet it is often overlooked.
One reason is that many youth coaches focus
primarily on the exercise itself, rather than on the
elements of speed within it. As a result, they create

“coach-directed” activities, rather than activities
that encourage both problem-solving and other
types of speed by the players themselves.

As an example of this, consider an exercise
involving dribbling where every player has a ball
and is dribbling freely in a defined area. Some youth
coaches condition the game by saying, “When I say
‘change’ then change direction.” They aim to train
players to react quickly to direction changes but
miss seeing that the decision to change directions
is dictated arbitrarily by the coach, rather than
what the players themselves see happening around
them. Such exercises might help develop technical
speed, but they are divorced from other important
components of speed, such as visual speed (what
the player sees and when he sees it), anticipatory
speed (anticipating when, where and how fast to
move), and reactive speed (movement of others
around him create new openings and block others).
Only game-like environments nurture these types of
speed. Therefore, coaches would do much better if
they provided problems for the players to solve and
aims for them to reach, rather than directing how
players should react to each situation.

For example, in the same type of exercise described
above, the coach might pose a problem for players
to solve: “See how many times you can move the
ball between two other players without touching
anyone or their ball.” The game itself, which
creates the environment around the players,
will dictate where and when openings occur for
dribbling or passing. Success will be dependent
upon each player’s ability to recognize, react and
technically move into those openings.

From Simple to Complex

The exercise described above is a very simple
environment because there are no opponents and
there is no prescribed direction to move or goals
to attack or defend. The size of the space and the
other players provide the complexity. The following


_28 The Best of Soccer Journal_

progression of activities provides a canvas for
discussing the development of different aspects
of speed. This is just one example, limiting the
concentration to the development of speed for one
type of decision-making. As a coach, you should
seek to find ways to help players develop different
components of speed in every activity they perform.
For continuity, the technical aspect in the following
activities will be passing and receiving ground
balls. The activities will gradually become more
complex, moving from a warm-up phase, then
a 4v4+4 (windows) non-directional activity, then
6v6+2 to three goals, and finally 6v6 to goals.

Warm-Up: Windows with four pairs passing
inside and four (window) players outside

Technical Speed

Technical speed depends on players’ first touch.
Players should be encouraged to never stop the
ball dead. They should always move the ball
somewhere with their first touch. This general
concept provides a technical foundation for speed
because it immediately puts opponents in the
posture of chasing, rather than dictating, the
direction of play. In the “Windows” format, the
movement of the other players in the area creates

the spaces that open for moving the ball with
the first touch. Players can be encouraged to
find these spaces before they receive the ball to
determine how they should approach the ball, as
well as the speed, direction, and distance of their
first touch. Furthermore, communication among
the players can be encouraged as part of technical
speed. This is especially crucial for young players
who may be self-conscious about talking.

Decision-Making Speed

The warm-up phase also provides a simple decision-
making environment for tactically applying the
technical movements. Since there are no opponents, the
technical and tactical aspects are readily recognizable,
and only where spaces open and close and not the
pressure of opponents trying to gain possession of
the ball affect the decisions of where, when, how to
react and make or receive passes.

Decision-making includes how players run to
receive passes. Do they open their bodies before
receiving the ball to increase their vision of the
field? Do they come back toward the passer at an
angle? Do they go away? Do they run diagonally?
Do they burst into short sprints? Do they fake one
way before going another? Similarly, issues for
the passers include how hard they play the ball,
whether they play it to feet or to space and to
which foot. All of these actions involve technical
development, but all are dictated by tactical
decisions about their immediate environment.

Windows: 4v4+4 (neutral window players)

Technical speed becomes more complex when
opponents are trying to take the ball away. Outside
targets create a numbers-up situation for the team
with the ball. The lack of directional play makes all
of the real estate inside the playing area worth the
same. Players can find space wherever it appears
without worrying about where they are on the field,
which helps to develop speed because it introduces

1


_Developing Speed of Play_

_Techniques  Tactics 29_

anticipatory and reactive speed based upon where
opponents are located. Players should understand
the field in a 360-degree dimension. Not having
directional play encourages players to seek out
the spaces not occupied by opponents, regardless
of where they are on the field. Its importance lies
in the truth that the ball can move faster than
the player. Therefore, when there is no particular
direction to play, the possessing team will freely
move _wherever_ space is open, freezing opponents in
certain places, or drawing them into those spaces
when the ball is played.

In this environment, different aspects of technical
speed become important – the direction of the first
touch is still paramount, but fakes before receiving
the ball and the distance the ball is played become
more important because opponents are reacting to
the passes. “Slowing down” opponents is another
aspect of speed. Coaches can help players develop
the ability to make opponents go or lean the wrong
way by focusing on what players do _before_ they
receive the ball, e.g., calling for the ball to draw
opponents toward them or checking for a pass in
one direction and then playing the first touch in
a different direction. In each case, the focus helps
players recognize how to “wrong foot” opponents.
With the introduction of opponents, the technical
and tactical aspects of speed converge. Speed is
recognizing how to use space and the ball to make

opponents move where we want them to move.
Using neutral players outside gives coaches the
opportunity to help the inside players create and
recognize spaces in the middle of the playing area.
Ever moving outside target players also help inside
players recognize the importance of body position
for increasing field vision, and, thus, visual speed,
when receiving passes from outside players.

Here, we want players to learn to immediately
recognize and exploit spaces away from opponents.
There are many different concepts for developing
speed of play: some coaches focus on combination
play, others on space in certain parts of the field.
My method here is to provide a general foundation,
based upon attacking principles, before defining
particular methods of applying those principles.
I usually begin by teaching players to look for
“meadows” on the field, in which to run or play the
ball as soon as they gain possession. A “meadow”
is any space where there are no opponents or
other teammates. The “meadow” concept can be
contrasted with a “forest” (where players of both
teams are defined as the trees). We encourage
players as soon as they gain possession to find
“meadows” for playing and receiving the ball.
Once they do so continuously, then we can show
them that the tendency of opponents is to follow
the ball into the “meadows.”

Once players understand this concept, we can
shift the focus to help players recognize the spaces
they have created between opponents. Using the
”meadows” and “forest” picture, we can show
players how their movement and the movement of
the ball into “meadows” cause opponents to move,
thereby increasing the amount of space between
the “trees” in the forest (we can call these spaces
“doorways”). Now players can look to leave the
“meadows,” run into those “doorways,” and to
play the ball (which is faster than the opponents)
through those “doorways.” It may sound simplistic,
but it is all about players continually recognizing
and reacting to the spaces that exist around them,
regardless of where they are on the field.

Adding Direction: 6v6+2 Neutral Attacking
Players with 3 Goals at Each End

When we add direction, the environment becomes
much more complex. Players have objective areas
to attack and defend, and these areas take on
different values for both teams. Attacking teams
want to score points, so they often “rush” into the
opponents’ crowded goal spaces (forests) without
creating the spaces between the “trees.” Defending
teams protect the goal areas more intensely by
increasing the number of “trees” in these areas.
Focus shifts to using the ball to speed up our own
play and understanding how to use the ball as
a decoy to slow opponents down. Where players
before considered all “meadows” equal, coaches
now can help them see how to play the ball into
and out of more and less important areas to draw
opponents away from their own goals and thereby
increase the size of the “doorways” between them.
The three goals at either end encourage attacking
teams to find “meadows” in other areas of the field
when the “forest” gets to thick near a particular goal.

6v6 to Two Goals

We can play 6v6 or 7v7 to two goals, building
upon the same space concepts. More complexity

is created both by having teams of equal numbers
and only one goal each to attack and defend.
Many coaches will try to choreograph play to
show players “how” to find space. “Guidance”
and “choreography” are two different things, and
coaches must resist the latter. Players’ decision-
making and the development of speed are all about
adaptation. Within this more difficult environment,
the coach helps players develop the ability to
recognize for themselves where the “meadows”
exist and how to use them to create “doorways” to
penetrate to an opponent’s goal.

Speed: It Is Player-Centered

Using progressively more complex environments
provides opportunities for players to develop their
own eyes and ways to solve the problems presented.
Speed of play is tied to each player’s recognition
of, and adaptability to, what the game presents.
Rather than focusing strictly on defining ways to
move the ball to goal, “guided discovery” enables
coaches to help players recognize for themselves
where spaces exist and how to play the ball to
open spaces where they want to go. These are the
types of environments that will truly develop the
different aspects of speed of play.

## Keeping the Ball in Play

Lou Pantuosco, Ph.D.
NSCAA Associate Staff Member

H

ow many hours have you spent in practice
waiting for players to come back in-bounds
after launching a pass or shot? How many times
have you seen a defender toe poke a ball 30 yards
away from the offensive opponent?

My guess is that most of the readers see these
every practice session. If you are like me, you
must say over and over, “Keep the ball in play.”
As coaches, how can we teach and how can they
become better players if the ball is out of bounds?
If the game is indeed the best teacher, we should
footnote this common statement by saying, “this is
true only if the ball is in play.”

On the surface, this sounds like a simple problem
to address, one that can easily be solved by yelling,
“Stop kicking the ball out of bounds.” But we know
that’s like saying, “Just put the ball in the back of
the net.”

We as coaches have recognized the problem;
now we have to implement solutions. In order to
implement solutions, we have to find the core of
the problem. I think there are two simple roots that
can be addressed: offensively, players must focus on
their first touch being soft and away from the closest
defender; defensively, players must win the ball, as
opposed to kicking it away from the opponent.

Focusing on these two concepts has many benefits.
Practices become more competitive, players are
more confident on the ball in tight spaces, players
are placed into a game-like environment and the
conditioning of the players improves. Like any
specific training, there are limitations, but I won’t
mention those.

Approaches to teach ball winning

Starting with the defensive perspective, it is not
complex to set up a session that emphasizes ball
winning. Put four players in a 10x10 grid. The
player with the ball is on offense, the other three
on defense. When the ball goes out of bounds by
a little, let play continue. If the ball goes far out of
bounds, one player chases the ball while the other
three players get on the ground and do push-ups,
sit-ups, whatever. Just make sure it is something
they do not enjoy doing and it is something they
can start and stop quickly. For groups of nine, make
three grids. After two minutes, take the players you
believe performed the best in each grid and put
them in grid 1. Take the players you thought were
the second strongest in each of the three grids and
put them in grid 2. Put the weakest three in grid

3. Now play again for two minutes, continuing the
process. Now let’s look at the coaching points.

Technical aspect of ball winning

For a great example, watch the Italian defense.
The one-on-one lesson begins after the defense is
organized behind the first defender.

Step 1: The first defender shows the offensive
player a side. Let’s say the first defender pushed the
attacker to the attacker’s right. Now the defender is
standing right foot forward.

Step 2: At the appropriate time, when the
attacker exposes the ball, the defender wants to
get the right foot as far in front of the attacker as
he can. Ideally, the defender should get his foot to
the other side of the attacker’s right foot. The next


_32 The Best of Soccer Journal_

step for the defender is to turn the shoulders in
the direction the ball is traveling and drop his/her
left foot back. The next step is to take one touch
away from the attacker with the right foot. Now
the defender has the ball. A key phrase to stress to
the defender is to not worry about the ball when
initiating the tackle – worry about the attacker.

What if the attacker is quick and skilled enough
to avoid the initial tackle (step 2 in the process
above)? This is not a problem because the
appropriate way to tackle is to use the front foot for
balance, getting it as close to the ball as possible
(the right foot in this example) and the back foot
wins the ball. Stressing this technique to win the
ball will pay dividends, but be patient. Players will
have a tendency to lunge, and a lot of times the
lunge works. But that doesn’t mean it is correct or that
we should encourage the lunge technique.

How to receive under pressure

Again, the setup doesn’t need to be complex. Put
players in groups of three. One player serves the

ball, the other two fight to receive and pass the
ball back to the server. Let’s call one of the non-
servers the offensive player and the other non-
server the defensive player. As the ball is served
in, the first step of the offensive player is into the
defensive player’s path toward the ball. So if the
defender is on the offensive player’s right side, the
offensive player first steps with his right foot into
the defensive player’s path. Absorbing the pressure,
the offensive player then wants his first touch to be
with his left foot, and the ball should be pushed
away from the defender, to the left. Players must
remember that they cannot receive a ball while
running at top speed. Even the best players slow
down their bodies when they receive. This is a
common high school problem. As players mature in
skill level, the speed at which they can receive and
control their first touch will increase.

The difficult part again is for the offensive player
to forget about the ball for a split second and think
about who may take the ball – the defender. The
ball has never stolen the ball from anyone, so why
worry about the ball?

Turning without moving the ball

This is something every coach should emphasize
during sessions on shielding. The offensive player,
A, has the ball on his right foot with his left foot
forward. The defensive player, B, is playing with his
right foot forward, allowing player A to go right.
Player B lunges in with his right foot. What should
player A do? The obvious answer is to move the
ball either forward or backward with his right foot.
Neither is necessarily correct. If you watch good
players, what do they do in this situation? As B
lunges with his right, A steps over B’s foot with his
left, shielding B from the ball. At the same time, A
turns his back as he shields. A then takes his right
leg and drops it back into the path of B. Next, A
pushes the ball with the inside of the left foot in
the direction he originally wanted to go. The whole
process takes about one second, because the feet
are working together to keep the defender away
from the ball. In summary, as B steps with his
right, A steps with his left, then steps backward
with his right and pushes the ball with his left. The
offensive player has to forget about the ball for a
split second and worry about the defender.

What about obstruction? Obstruction is nearly
impossible to call in this example. A is always

playing the ball. I have not mentioned anything
about how the offensive player uses his arms (that
is for another article).

Any small-sided game in tight space can be used
to emphasize this ball winning and possession
oriented first-touch technique. The results are that
players will be less likely to turn into the defender
and expose the ball, players will learn to use their
bodies, defenders will be forced to play offense,
practices become more intense, and the ball stays
in bounds.

## Learning to Be Creative .........................................................................................................................................

Ron Quinn, Ph.D.
Xavier University
US Soccer Staff Coach

T

he game of soccer has been described as a
simple game, a beautiful game, a game of
strength, speed and finesse. A game of creativity
and problem solving. Much effort has been spent
on developing players’ technique, strength and
speed; however, creativity and problem solving
receive the least amount of attention.

Creativity in soccer is the ability to solve technical
and tactical problems in the most efficient manner.
A creative player is able to do the unexpected at
the most opportune time. Problem solving is the
ability to interpret multiple incoming stimuli
and select the most appropriate solution. When it
comes to playing the game, coaches instruct young
players when and where to pass, dribble, shoot or
position themselves on the field, consequently not
providing much chance to solve problems.

Even though small-sided games have gained
acceptance as an appropriate component of a
youth soccer practice, we still see strong evidence
of the drill mentality.

How an individual acquires these skills is a
combination of individual characteristics and
environmental conditioning and development.
It is believed in most sports, soccer included,
that our best players may come out of an urban
environment and may be underprivileged. Perhaps
these individuals at a very early age learn how to
solve problems and develop creative solutions just
to survive, and as a result, their ability to survive
through problem solving is transferred onto the
soccer field. Although this certainly has merit,
it also ignores a majority of the present soccer-
playing population.

The real issue is not so much the childhood
environment but the playing environment to which
young players are exposed. Just as we improve
ball handling ability through dynamic practice
repetition, we can improve problem-solving ability
through a training setting in which players have
multiple opportunities to scheme, create and figure
out activity solutions. As an example, if young
players aged 5-9 play 4v4 without goalkeepers,
the player who recognizes an opportunity to shoot
from 20 yards out has just extended his or her
field of vision and was able to quickly respond to
a penetrating channel on the field (Diagram # 1).

If we played with goalkeepers, the opportunity
and therefore ability to recognize the particular
shot or field of vision are not created. We also use
games/activities, such as a variety of ball-chasing
and freeze tag type of games with young children
so that they develop a certain way of thinking that
has implications for the game.

1


_Learning to Be Creative_

_Techniques  Tactics 35_

The development of a young soccer player takes
time. All aspects of the game are at work all the
time; nothing happens in isolation. The physical,
psychological and emotional domains continuously
interact in every practice activity. The difficulty
we have seen with youth soccer practices is that
they are too scripted and comprised of static,
mindless types of drill. Slalom dribbling through
a series of cones in a straight line is a prime
example. What game problems are solved and
what psychological/motivational aspects of the
game are addressed?

When we examine the thought process in motor
skill development, action is always preceded by
thought or some process of interpreting stimuli.
In soccer, players receive countless amounts of
environmental information. Individual movement,
teammate movements, opponent movements,
ball movement, coach instructions, parent/fan
instructions, etc., are received by every player.

How players handle and process this information,
which at times could be called information
overload, plays a critical role in the decision-
making process. Information is first received
via a stimulus identification stage, followed by
a response selection stage in which relevant
information is selected and sent to a response
programming stage. The response programming

stage organizes this information into a specific
plan of action, which is then sent onto the motor
program stage for execution. What coaches need to
understand is that all of this information is received
simultaneously, but the resulting actions are serial
in nature, meaning that in the early stages of skill
development, performing multiple tasks at the
same time is very difficult. In addition, the age and
maturity level of players affect their information
processing ability, as well as their comfort level and
sense of maturity within the training session.

Younger players, age 5-9, for example, have a
more limited field of vision, motor control, spatial
awareness, knowledge of rules, etc., than players
age 10 or older. Therefore, we need to provide a
game structure that is appropriate for the age in
terms of matching the players’ ability to process
relevant information better. In short, the need for
small-sided games and a variety of game/activities
is critical for the beginning player. Additionally, we
need to realize that it is difficult for a child, or any
player for that matter, to be creative when being
yelled at.

Memory is another component. When someone
has to think about doing something – making a
decision – a great deal of time is needed. Time in
soccer is a precious commodity. Thus the task of the
coach and player is to develop skills and decision-
making abilities that are more or less automatic,
without a high degree of conscious thought.

Essentially, we need to develop positive tendencies
that are automatic. To arrive at the level of
“automatic pilot,” a player needs to move through
three distinct stages: a) verbal cognitive stage, in
which a player has a basic understanding of what
he or she is trying to accomplish; b) the motor
stage, where the various motor programs and
abilities are developed; and c) the autonomous
stage, in which we perform certain movements
without thought. The soccer coach needs to be
familiar with this motor program concept from
the standpoint that each movement in soccer

1A


_36 The Best of Soccer Journal_

is singular, yet never completely new. What this
means is that every movement produced is, to
some degree, a variation of previous movements.
In soccer, there are an unlimited number of
movements, responses and decisions. However,
when practice exercises are presented in which
the player repeats a movement at the same
distance and speed, through several repetitions,
the effectiveness of learning is questionable.

Therefore, the effectiveness of “passing drills” that
are at a fixed distance or slalom dribbling through
cones should be seriously questioned. If we want to
improve a player’s passing ability to a target, then
each passing trial should be different from the
previous one. An example is using what is called
variable practice. With variable practice, each trial
is conducted within a range of predetermined
distance. Instead of two players passing back and
forth from a distance of 15 yards, they should
pass and move within this distance, making one
pass at a five-yard distance, then another at 10,
then three, followed by 12 or 15 yards, etc. In
this way, although it may not look as structured
and effective as the common one- or two-touch
passing at a fixed distance, the ability of a player
to reconstruct the needed motor program during
match play would be stronger. Essentially, rote
memory (rehearsal) does not provide the player
a better opportunity to understand and execute
match demands. Variable practice does.

In Diagram # 2 we see an exercise in which the
coach has established a variable passing sequence
through a cone-defined target. By varying the
distance and/or the size of the target, the players
are required to make technical adjustments from
pass to pass. In the first exercise, they must pass
the ball accurately so it can be handled by the
receiver from a distance of five yards within 2-3
touches. As the pass is released, the player moves
back to the next line (7.5 yards), ready to receive
and re-pass the ball to the other player who
repeats the sequence. Finally, following the second
pass, the players move back 10 yards from the goal

and repeat the process, eventually moving back to
the five-yard distance with the next two passes.

By establishing as many of these passing gates as
needed to accommodate the squad, the coach can
have the team achieve a great many passing and
receiving touches at varying distances.

A second variation would include passing from
constantly varying distances but having one player
return the ball outside a widened, cone-defined
target to the originating passer. This assures
movement by his or her teammate in receiving the
ball (Diagram # 3).

_Learning to Be Creative_

_Techniques  Tactics 37_

Further, the exercises, after practice and
technique correction have taken place, can be
made competitive. How long to make 10 passes
between teammates? Establish a time limit and
count passes. The size of the target can be widened
or shortened. While this is a reasonable exercise
for 5-9 age group players, adding footedness or
surface of the feet or number of touches, can
elevate its degree of difficulty for older youth players
as well.

The purpose of practice is to create an environment
so that what is “practiced” transfers into the game.
We measure learning from what we see in the
game performance. However, how many times
has a coach watched a game only to say to an
assistant or players on the bench, “When did
we practice that?” obviously referring to a play
that was not, in his or her mind, practiced. The
problem may arise from a common notion that if
we repeat a movement continuously until it meets
a certain level of performance, also known as
blocked practice, it then appears as if the player
has learned the movement. The coach and players
leave practice happy, only to find that the transfer
of the movement into the game may be minimal.
Research has demonstrated that practicing a
criterion skill in a blocked or an unvarying practice
format does not enhance the learning process.

A random practice format in which the player
performs different movements in a random fashion
is more effective in the actual retention, learning
and transfer of that movement task. Earlier, we
discussed the aspect of the production of motor
programs. Each time an individual presented the
opportunity to reconstruct a particular motor
program, it is strengthened. The player is presented
a situation in which he or she must perform a
technical movement from a range of alternatives.
This process is effective because it more actively
engages the player. Repeating a movement without
variation of change does not provide the depth
of learning as with random practice. Although
“functional training” is not recommended for young

players, game activities and small-sided games are
strongly encouraged.

Game activities and small-sided games have
been increasingly used (but not enough) in youth
practices for their fun, social interaction, increased
ball touches and decision-making opportunities.
However, the motor learning research on the
effectiveness of random practice on skill acquisition
clearly reinforces the need for young players to
learn the game through game activities and small-
sided games. Organized drills may look good and
give the coach a sense of control, but they are
truly not an effective practice activity. Drills in
this sense are a practice structure in which players
are repeating the same movement over and over
without variation, usually in some form of line
that involves players waiting for their turn. Game
activities, on the other hand, engage all players,
allow for a wide range of ability levels, allow for the
opportunity to practice a variety of movement tasks
and engage the body and mind more completely.
In Diagram # 4, we see a 4v4 game with each
team defending two goals and attacking two goals.
Player O1 with the ball must make a decision to

dribble and attack either of the two B goals or
possibly pass to a teammate while the players
without the ball must also make decisions whether

4


_38 The Best of Soccer Journal_

to attack the ball or defend spaces. The transition
in play is readymade to elevate the decision making
ability of all eight players. Again, depending on the
maturity of the age group, the demands can be
lessened (3 v. 3, larger or smaller spaces, etc.) or
increased (two balls in play, regulation goals with
keepers, etc.) in order to make the game work.

Coaches must realize that the mind does not
disengage when the body engages. If we want
players to become better decision makers, thereby
improving playing performance, then decision-
making and production of motor programs must
not be exclusive.

From the perspective of player development, we
must embrace the viewpoint that growth is a
process. Players do not develop in just one season;
it takes several years. Unfortunately, many young
players are either selected out or drop out at too
early an age, largely because playing is no longer

enjoyable. Players need to play fast, think fast and
act fast, but in order to develop these fast players,
we need to maintain their interest in the game.
Speed is relative.

In our fast-paced society, in order to develop the
brilliant player, we need to slow down in order to
go further.

## Coaching Long Passing .........................................................................................................................................

_Techniques  Tactics 39_

## Coaching Long Passing

David Saward, Jeff Vennell and Doug Williamson
NSCAA Academy Staff

L

ong passing is a technique that is not
practiced enough by many coaches. Long,
accurate, penetrating passes, especially to forwards
who are showing for a ball, and the ability to
change the point of attack quickly and accurately
are musts in the modern game. Coaches should
be aware that they should focus on one central
theme during a practice session using only a
limited number of exercises for a specific technical
practice. The exercises that follow may also be used
for other techniques. Remember that the selection
of practice exercises is determined by the thematic
“thread” that the coach pulls throughout the fabric
of the practice session.

Warm-up exercises

Coaches should be careful during the warm-up phase
of practices that players begin with passes that are
somewhat shorter than the length of passes that will
occur during the concluding warm-up activities. Be
certain that your players are warmed up properly
and are stretched sufficiently to prevent injury.

Exercise 1

Short, short, long passing in groups of five. Begin
with players in a 30 x 30-yard space and expand
as needed (Diagram # 1). Player receiving the long
pass should take a controlling touch and dribble
the ball a few times. Then passes begin again –
short, short, long. The long pass should be made to
the player farthest from the passer as other players
run to support the player receiving the long pass.
Keep the ball moving, using the central players as
obstacles to play around or over.

- Add a wall-pass upon reception of the long

- Add a double pass upon reception of the long pass.
- Add takeover upon reception of the long pass.

Exercise 2

This is a team knockout activity with two teams
of eight or more players in a half field. One team
begins inside the field each with a ball with
the objective of keeping possession of the ball
through dribbling. The other team begins on the

outside and enters the half field at the start with
the goal of dispossessing the dribblers and then
clearing all the balls into the other half field. Keep
time until all the balls are cleared out of the half
field. Change roles. Use a reward, e.g., winning
team does 15 sit-ups, losing team does 30 sit-ups.

Main lesson exercises

long passes are struck to:

- feet of players showing for a pass or
- spaces, usually ahead of attacking players running toward goal.

There are three basic types of long passes:

- driven or line drive passes;
- lofted or air passes;
- hooked or sliced passes.

Coaching long passing or any technique should involve movement to replicate game
conditions. Technical coaching points for all three types of long passing include:

- having the ball “out of feet” to enable a good strike of the ball;
- an approach to the ball from an angle;
- a hop onto the support foot, with the hop step slightly longer than the last running step;
- some coaches recommend that the support foot should be placed slightly behind the ball, others
    recommend the support foot be placed slightly farther away to the side of the ball;
- follow through toward target, except for the long sliced pass;
- Each type of long pass has its own individual technical coaching points: for the driven long pass,
    the toe is pointed down and the ball is struck through the middle of the ball; for the lofted long
    pass, the toe is again pointed down, but the ball is struck below the center; for the hooked long
    pass, the toe is pointed up at impact and the ball is struck left of center for right footed pass;
- for the sliced long pass the toe is pointed down and the ball is kicked “across” the ball following
    through with the leg across the body.
- Coaches are reminded that the sizes of the spaces noted for each exercise should be adjusted for
    ability levels. It is always better to start larger and then make the area smaller if the technical level
    of the players permits a smaller space.


_Coaching Long Passing_

_Techniques  Tactics 41_

Exercise 1

6(3+3)v3; 30 x 50-yards. Three teams of three
(Diagram # 2).

Two teams play possession from the third team;
team that loses possession becomes the defender.
Note: the most effective pass most of the time is
a longer accurate pass to the far end of the space.

- Play two or three touch.
- Keep the same three players on defense for
    a certain time frame, counting the number
    of touches by the defensive teams before
    changing the defensive team.

Exercise 2

7 v. 4; 44 x 35-yards. Seven players maintain
possession from four (Diagram # 3)

Play for 2½ to 3 minutes and then change
offensive and defensive players. The incentive for
the four defenders is to touch the ball equal to or
more than the number of long passes by the seven
offensive players.

- 7’s – three touches maximum, seven
    consecutive passes equals a goal. 4’s –
    unlimited touches, four consecutive passes
    equals a goal.

Exercise 3

3v3 plus two targets; 44 x 50-yards
(Diagram # 4)

Teams of three players attempt to make a
penetrating pass as soon as possible to target
player at the end of the grid.

- To encourage long pass, reward if ball arrives
    to target player in the air.
- Team that makes successful pass maintains
    possession and plays to target player at the
    other end.

One red vs. three blue/white in one zone; one
blue/white vs. three red in the next zone; one red
vs. three blue/white in the next zone; three reds vs.
one blue/white in the final zone. Complete passes
across zones for points. Two or three touches per
player. Players leave their zone.

- Two balls, unlimited touches; one defensive
    player in each half can go into another zone to
    create a 3v2.
- One ball, otherwise the same as previous
    exercise.

Exercise 5

4v4 with two target players; full width x 60
yards with field divided into two 30-yard
halves (Diagram # 6)

- Play to the target players but the pass must
    originate from within the half of the field most
    distant from the intended target player. The
    target player receives the ball and plays a

long pass to the other target player, who then
plays the ball to the other team. Coaches can
suggest/limit the type of pass, i.e., driven,
lofted, bent, etc.

- Alternate the target players with field players
    frequently

Exercise 6

5v5 ; half field; four full-size goals. Change
the point of attack options (Diagram # 7)

- Unlimited, three, two and one touch restrictions
    can apply
- Can progress to 7v7 with two balls
- One goal halfway along each side of the end

## Developing the Long Game ..................................................................................................................................

Paul Payne
NSCAA Academy Senior Staff

A

s a coach, you need to recognize your
players’ abilities in performing a successful
long pass. Once players have the leg strength,
the proper technique of striking a ball over long
distances needs to be addressed in your training.
An example of such a training session is set up
below. I have used this session with youth players
as well as college age players. As with any session,
the coach needs to adapt the training to the
team’s abilities.

Warm-up and fundamental stage
(Diagram # 1)

Organization
12 players: 8 players paired (blue/ white) knocking
short balls to each other while freely moving
around the field; four neutral players (red) moving
around the same area. When a neutral red calls for
a ball from the blue pairs, the ball is served using
the proper technique. The non-serving blue player
moves to support the long pass and receives back

from the neutral red player. The blue pairs then
continue to pass short until another neutral red
player is free. It is important that the players are
properly stretched, focusing on the quadriceps
and hamstrings prior to beginning this phase of
the session.

Progression
Begin by having players work on serving driven
balls both on the ground and in the air.

Coaching points (for driven balls)

- Ball must be “out of feet.”
- Approach from a slight angle.
- “Hop” onto support foot, pointed forward,
- slightly behind ball.
- Toe pointed down, ankle locked striking
    through the middle of the ball.
- Follow through to target.

After a brief stretch, demonstrate the next service
of a lofted pass.

Coaching points

- Ball must be “out of feet.”
- Approach from more of an angle.
- Hop onto support foot, pointed forward slightly
    behind ball.
- Player leans back more.
- Toe pointed down, striking ball left of middle.
- Strike through ball, extending to the target.

Stretch before introducing the proper technique of
bending and hooking a long ball pass.

Coaching points

- Toe pointed up at impact when hooking with
    inside of foot.

2A


_Developing the Long Game_

_Techniques  Tactics 45_

- Toe pointed down at impact when slicing with
    outside of foot.
- Kicking “across” the ball.
- Follow through is across (slicing) or away from
    (hooking) the body.

Main phase: exercise 1

(Diagram # 2)

Organization
Playing in three zones across the field, divide
players into three teams of four. Four reds play
against two blue/whites in Zone 1, looking to
play the ball safely into Zone 2, where four white
players are stationed. Restrict to two touches and
a maximum of three passes before the ball must
be played into next zone. If the two blue/whites
displace the reds of the ball in Zone 1 or if the
ball is not played cleanly through the neutral
zone, blue/whites play the ball into Zone 2 and
the waiting white players. Two reds must then go
defend against the four whites in Zone 2 while
the other two reds occupy the neutral zone. Vary
conditions to ensure early success, then increase
demands on the players. For example, make a
tighter space in which to play or allow three
defenders in.

Coaching points

- Make sure players are using the proper
    technique when choosing to serve.
- Defensive pressure will dictate what type of
    service is best.
- As always, communication and vision need to
    be stressed.

Main phase: exercise 2
(Diagram # 2B)

Organization
Divide a rectangular playing area into four zones.
Three teams of four whites, four reds vs. four blue/
whites. In each zone, a 10 x 10 target is laid out
with a white player in each target area. Free play,
with each team looking to maintain possession
until the long diagonal pass is on. In order to score,
the ball must be played cleanly into a white target
player from a diagonal zone.

Variations

- For a point to be scored, a supporting player
    from the servicing team must receive a one-
    touch pass from the white target player.
- The white player, upon receiving a quality long
    pass, plays the ball to another white target
    player, who then would play the ball out to the
    team that successfully serviced the ball.

2A 2B


_46 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Coaching points
In addition to the points mentioned in exercise 1,
also look at how quickly players can recognize that
the long diagonal pass is on and that the proper
technique is executed.

Final phase (Diagram # 3)

Organization
Playing full-sided soccer with goalies, divide the
field into thirds lengthwise. Have players look
to play long balls safely from one flank zone
to another flank zone. You also can place the
restriction that the ball must be played through
all three zones to encourage opening up the field,
which will lend itself to more opportunities for long
ball passing. As with any training session, always
end with free play with no restrictions.

The first principle of attack is penetration. Ideally
you want to accomplish this by focusing on the
techniques that will achieve it. A successful long
ball pass is just one technique that can do just that.

## Shooting Exercises

Jeff Vennell
NSCAA Senior Academy Staff

F

ollowing are shooting exercises utilized by Jeff
Vennell as part of the teaching process at the
NSCAA National Diploma Courses. Each involves a
great many shooting opportunities for the players
— with little down time!

1v1 Recovery Game: Diagram # 1

A1 dribbles as close to B’s goal as he/she wants
and shoots. As soon as A1 shoots, he/she retreats
to play in goal as B1 dribbles and shoots at A1.
Repeat with A2 dribbling at B1, who is retreating
to play goal. Four players by each goal, alternating
in and out after each shoots once and defends
their goal one time. Have plenty of balls available
or arrange for the shooter who misses to be
responsible for retrieving their ball.

2v1 — Both Directions: Diagram # 2

A1 and A2 attack B1 and shoot on B2 (who tends
goals). If they score, they get another ball and
attack B3 (B4 becoming the goalkeeper). If they
miss or the shot is saved or if they lose the ball,
B2 joins B1 and they attack A3 & A6 (one of
whom becomes the goalkeeper). Another variation
would be to have the two-person teams remain on
the field for a short time (60 seconds) with rapid
attack/counterattack taking place.

2v2 + Side Support: Diagram # 3

Eight players form four two-person teams. The
two teams in the middle play 2v2 with goalkeepers.
If a team scores, it receives another ball from its
keeper and re-attacks. If a team loses the ball
before shooting, they are on defense. Either team
with the ball can utilize any of the four support

(^1) players to maintain possession and/or to free
2


_48 The Best of Soccer Journal_

themselves for shooting opportunities. Restrictions
(time of game; number of passes before a shot
must be executed, limited touches, etc.) can be
placed on the game.

2v2 + End Support: Diagram # 4

This game places the supporting players at the
end lines of a 36-yard x 44-yard field. One game
may be staged where the attacking team may use
their end line players for support in order to free
themselves for a shot on goal, while another game
can require the teams to use those players before
they can attempt a shot on goal.

The manner of scoring may be restricted in that
goals may be scored only via ground passes or
perhaps passes in the air (volleys or headers).

Three-Sided Goal Game: Diagram # 5

Three teams of six players each play in a triangle
44 yards long on each side. Place balls by each
goal. Three of the six players from each team deal
with two balls being in play at the same time.
When a ball crosses a team’s sideline, then one of
the players (a designated server) plays the ball in
to a teammate (one player serves as goalkeeper,

the other as a ball chaser). Teams score in either of
the other two goals. Again, restrictions can be put
on the game. Following a prescribed period of time,
the teams change positions.

Services/Crosses Exercise:
Diagram # 6

Two teams of four organized around the penalty
area. The shooting bouts last 90 seconds, with
services alternating between those from the coach
and crosses from the sides. The shooters are
restricted to one-touch shooting or one-touch
passing to a teammate, who then must hit a first-

time shot. Have plenty of balls available. Coaches
may wish to add a third four-person team on the
goal line to retrieve balls.

Opposed Shooting: Diagram # 7

The game emphasizes one-time shooting or one-
time passes to teammates for one-time shooting.
In the Diagram #, Team A is defended by Team
B. If B wins the ball, they play it out to the coach,
then compete for possible shots on goal with A
defending. Establish a rotational order for the

servers. There are no headers in this game. Rotate
groups and keep cumulative scores for each team.

Knock Out — 4v4 + Goalkeepers:
Diagram # 8

Play 4v4 for a set number of goals or for a set time.
Play can start with a two-touch restriction, then
go to one touch. Goalkeepers can shoot only on a
back pass, not to start or restart the game. There
are no corner kicks in the game. A third group can
be used of four resting/retrieving. The winners stay

on, losers go off. If shots miss, a rotational order
can be established for the X servers to play balls in
to restart play.

## Exercise for Sharp Shooting..................................................................................................................................

Mike Berticelli
Past Director of Coaching NSCAA

M

odern soccer has put all kinds of new
demands on players, and shooting is no
exception. According to recent analysis, most
successful shots come from inside the penalty box.
However, shooting from outside the box can be a
very effective way of stretching compact defenses.
And while space is limited and defensive pressure
heightened for all players, attackers are operating
in minimal space and maximal opposition as they
try for quality strikes on goal.

For all these reasons, it’s time to rethink traditional
shooting exercises and construct more practical
practice games that replicate the real demands of
today’s soccer.

Warm-up exercises: Exercise 1

- Two goals with goalkeepers, about 40 yards
    apart, 20-25 yards in width.
- Two teams of three.
- Divide the field into three zones of 5, 10 and
    15 yards.
- Each team starts in one of the end zones.

Combinations and shot on goal (Diagram # 1)

- The players in group A pass back and forth
    among themselves inside their zone until one
    of them is in a position to shoot.
- The shooter dribbles a short distance, then
    shoots out of the zone on the opposite goal.
- As soon as player A shoots, the players in
    group B must run around the corner cones or
    the goal, as shown.
- After the shot, the goalkeeper distributes to
    one of the players in group B. They repeat the
    above procedure and so on.

Focus on

- Accurate passing (right pace on the ball).
- Confident ball control (watch first touch by
    shooter).
- Accurate distance shooting (sight keeper first,
    watch ball).

Exercise 2 (Diagram # 2)

Setup is the same as in exercise 1, but with extra
balls placed by each goal.
Combinations and direct shot:

- Same as above, except now the shooter shoots
    on the first touch, that is directly off the pass
    without dribbling.
- If this proves too difficult, back off and allow
    the shootern a second touch to control the ball
    before shooting.

Focus on

- Precise ball striking/accurate distance shooting;
    correct body position prior to the pass and
    examine body/leg position as strike ball as
    well as follow through (strike through the ball).
- Accurate passing.

Exercises with opposition pressure:
Exercise 3 (Diagram # 3)

Setup is the same as before except there are four
players in each zone instead of three, creating a
3v1 situation in each end zone.

- Note that as with all the exercises there are
    plenty of balls available by the goals so there is
    no shutdown of play.


_Exercise for Sharp Shooting_

_Techniques  Tactics 51_

3v1 with distance shot:

- Play starts with a 3v1 in front of goal 1.
- The three attackers try to get a clear shot at
    the opposite goal, while the defender tries to
    interfere with their combinations and/or block
    their shots. If the defender wins the ball, he
    can attack on goal 1.
- After a long shot, play starts again in the
    opposite direction either by goalkeeper
    distribution off the shot or with the insertion
    of a new ball.

Variations

- To emphasize ball control, limit shooters to one
    touch prior to the shot.
       - Elevate play by insisting on first-touch shooting.
       - If ball control is not up to standard, evaluate
          whether to lengthen and widen the grid (i.e.,
          50 x 30 yards).

Exercise 4 (Diagram # 4)

Setup is the same as in exercise 3.
3v1 with direct distance shot:

- As above, play starts with a 3v1.
- Now, however, the shooter can play the ball
    ahead into the middle zone before shooting.
- The shooter runs onto the ball in the middle
    zone then must shoot directly.

1 2

3 4


_52 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Variation

- The shooter is limited to two touches (he or she
    may control the ball in the middle zone with
    one of those touches before shooting).

Exercise 5 (Diagram # 5)

Setup is the same as in exercise 4.
Continuous 3v1 with distance shots:

- As above, play starts with a 3v1.
- Now, however, attackers may also use the
    middle zone to build their attack, so that close-
    range shots also are possible.
- After shooting or losing the ball, the attackers
    and their defender return to the zone in front
    of their goal and the other group starts a new
    3v1 in the opposite direction, etc.

Focus on

- Confident combination play (note that play is
    now in a 30 x 20 area; spread out offensively).
- Accurate shooting, even under opposition
    pressure (look up even before or as ball is
    passed to sight the keeper’s position; “pass the
    ball” into the goal).

Exercise 6 (Diagram # 6)

Setup is the same as in exercise 5.
Long shot from a combination:

- As in exercise 5, play starts with a 3v1 in two
    zones.
- Now, however, attackers have yet another
    opportunity to score by passing to a “forward”
    (the single defender in the opposite zone), who
    acts as a target player. The target player tries
    to “lay off” balls to the middle zone for a first-
    time shot.
- Goals coming off combinations with the target
    player count double.

Variation

- Initially, and to make the exercise easier, the
    target player may not be defended with high
    pressure.

Exercise 7 (Diagram # 7)

Setup is the same as in exercise 6, except that we
add a second defender in each zone, creating 3v2
situations in each zone.

3v2 with a long shot:

- Play now begins with a 3v2 in two zones.
- Attackers can pass to their two teammates in
    the zone in front of the opposite goal.

5

6


_Exercise for Sharp Shooting_

_Techniques  Tactics 53_

- The two forwards have two options for scoring:
    they can pass back to a teammate in the
    middle zone for a long shot; or they can shoot
    directly, either by beating an opponent 1v1 or
    through a combination effort with their twin
    striker.

Variation

- Only the two forwards can score.
- Same as above but one of the strikers from the
    second zone can move into the other zone to
    create a 4v2 situation.

Exercise 8 (Diagram # 8)

Setup is the same as above, but with two teams
of five.

5v5 with special shooting rules:

- The two teams play without zones (a game of
    5v5 on two goals with goalkeepers).
- To score, players must follow this sequence: An
    attacker must pass to a teammate in front of
    the opposite goal; this teammate passes back
    to another attacker for the shot (a three-man
    combination).
- Once the back pass has been made to set
    up a shot, the defense backs off to allow the
    attacker a clear shot.

Variation

- Attackers can score on any type of
    combination, but shots made following the
    sequence described above count double.
- Lift all restrictions and play – and score –
    from a distance if possible.

Obviously the 5v5 game can evolve into an 8v8
game (with zones or without) played from goal to
goal (with a 44-yard width) with the emphasis on
well-taken shots from outside the box. These long
distance strikes might be rewarded with a double
count if they score, etc.

## Keep the Shot Low ..................................................................................................................................................

Jack Detchon
NSCAA Senior Academy Staff

T

he following are shooting exercises. In all
cases, you should emphasize low shooting for
the following reasons:

- There will be more mishandles by the keeper
    as it is harder for the keeper to get to the balls;
- High balls are more reaction saves, and
    generally easier to keep out of the goal.

Exercise 1 (Diagram # 1)

Set up for exercises 1 through 7: In an area 44x36-
yards, two teams of six players, two goalkeepers,
supply of balls by each goal.

Organization
Goalkeeper throws (rolls) the ball at slight angle
and player may not use more than one touch to
shoot on goal; teammate in other line runs, under
control (don’t let ball rebound past you), to goal to
clean up any rebounds. Players return to original

lines. Goalkeepers distribute balls so that everyone
shoots. Alternate shots from each goal.

Variation
Have players from each team count the number of
successful goals from first exercise to last. Make it
competitive.

Exercise 2 (Diagram # 2)

Organization
Goalkeeper services the ball at sharper angle,
forcing the shooter to align hips and body to the
goal. Again, shooting on first or second touch. First
two teammates in second line follow up the shot,
one centrally, second player running wide, both
looking for rebounds. As soon as one ball is shot
and play is over, group at other goal proceeds in
the same manner.

1 2


_Keep the Shot Low_

_Techniques  Tactics 55_

Exercise 3 (Diagram # 3)

Organization
First player in non-shooting line moves out to serve
as target player with ball played in and laid off in
a lateral/forward position. Shooter holds position
so that he or she arrives to ball at proper time to
deliver a shot within one touch. Target player turns
and follows up misplays by keeper. Return to lines
and second goal group repeats.

Exercise 4 (Diagram # 4)

Organization
Same exercise as above except ball is laid
backwards for holding player to run onto for shot.
This time ask that players hit ball with the outside
of the foot. They should seek to spin or bend the
ball on goal.

Exercise 5 (Diagram # 5)

Organization
Goalkeeper serves wide (as per exercise 2) and first
player in second line runs to pressure shooter who
must shoot with no more than one touch. Repeat
from opposite goal.

Exercise 6 (Diagram # 6)

Organization
Instead of trying to combat the taking of the shot
on no more than the first touch, the first player
in second line tries to run to a point where a
deflection of the shot is possible (Diagram # 5, run
labeled 2).

Exercise 7 (Diagram # 7)

Organization
Opposite line sets up as target player and lays

3 4

5


_56 The Best of Soccer Journal_

ball off to shooter who must shoot with no more
than one touch. Target player tries to run to spot
to intercept, block, deflect attempt on goal. Repeat
from opposite goal.

Exercise 8

Organization
12 players arranged in 5v1 games in each half of
a 20x36-yard field. Two keepers. Supply of balls by
each goal.

Stage 1
Five players must try to play ball off target player
and shoot with no more than one touch. Five
players in opposite end try to cut off angles for
shot. Shooter tries to find openings with teammate
ready to pounce on rebounds, caroms, etc. Game
is continuous as long as ball is in play. Play over
side or end line starts with goalkeeper of team
in possession starting play. Team in possession
seeks to spread play out to allow for shooting
opportunities. Passing can be restricted to two
touch or less.

Stage 2
Play 4v2 in each half of the field.

Exercise 9

Organization
Two teams of six play in 20x36-yard field. Two
goalkeepers. Game is throw-volley-catch. Idea is to
throw the ball low so that volley shots (or passes)
are in order. Ball can be struck off throw either
in air or on first bounce (half volley). Can also
emphasize use of outside of foot volleys.

Repetition is the key
It should be emphasized that shooting exercises
need to be designed for a good number of
repetitions to take place (have plenty of soccer
balls on hand) and that in each of these exercises
there must be an emphasis on a quick examination
of where an opening exists, getting the body (and
shooting foot) ready and striking through the ball.
Pressure must be applied by defenders to make the
exercises realistic, and teammates must be ready to
pounce on mistakes by the defense.

England following a successful stint as coach at
Kenyon College (Ohio). He is a member of the

## Shaping Runs Off the Ball

How to improve body positioning and the angle of runs

Douglas J. Williamson, Ph.D.
NSCAA Senior National Staff Coach

M

ost youth players, even those who play
for highly competitive clubs, could benefit
from increased tactical training in body positioning
and the shaping of runs off the ball. The evidence
for this judgment may be found in a number of
sights that one can find repeated ad infinitum on
American soccer fields. For example:

- Forwards sprinting to balls played down
    touchlines, backs to the goal, getting trapped
    against the line by defenders who do not allow
    them to turn
- Central strikers and midfielders checking back
    vertically (parallel to touchlines), limiting
    their vision and restricting their ability to play
    forward upon reception
- Forwards running full tilt away from the ball,
    parallel to the touchlines, forcing teammates
    to try to play low-percentage, over-the-
    top forward passes as the only option for
    penetrating a defense
- Flank players making runs that allow defenders
    to watch both the ball and the attacker, rather
    than bending away from the defender, so that
    he/she cannot watch both ball and player at
    the same time
- Flank players having crossing balls fly past
    them because they have run on a straight line
    toward the goal, rather than bending their
    runs in such a way that they can “frame the
    goal” and either collect a pass or finish with a
    powerful shot at goal

Some of the observers feel strongly that one of the
major weaknesses of the American national teams
is an inability to make creative and tactically astute
runs off the ball. This is perhaps not surprising
when one realizes that this is a characteristic of
most of the play in our country at the youth level.

Rather than bemoan the obvious, it would seem
that our task as coaches is to work to help our
advanced players learn better body positioning
and more effective attacking runs off the ball
in the context of match play. There are many
ways to do this, but this article will discuss three
exercises that may help players improve their play
in this area. The first exercise is a relatively simple
passing and receiving session. The second and
third exercises are more complex training sessions.
Each exercise can be developed in such a way as
to compose an entire training session, or portions
of the exercises can be used as components of an
extended practice.

The first exercise is a simple “windows” session.
The standard space presumes 16-18 players and
is approximately 44x35 yards in size. In the
first activity in this session, the players in the
middle of the field have soccer balls and play the
longest possible instep-driven ball to a player in
a “window,” then follow the ball and get it back.
What is essential at this fundamental stage of
training is that the coach insists that the players
following their pass to get the ball back check to
the window at an angle, so that their first touch
can be made facing into the bulk of the field
(Diagram # 1).


_58 The Best of Soccer Journal_

In the second activity, quite similar to the first, the
players in the middle with the ball play a short pass
to a window player, then sprint to the closest place
on the perimeter of the field and receive a firmly
struck pass across one’s body before exploding
off with the ball and then repeating the sequence
(Diagram # 2).

Once players have had the chance to practice
some technical repetitions of the desired skills,
the coach may progress to a possession game,
with four players from one team and four players

from the opposite team in the center of the field.
The other players from the two teams stand in
alternating “windows” around the perimeter of
the field (Diagram # 3). The scoring objective for
both teams is to complete seven consecutive passes
to score a goal. Each time one of the teams has
the ball, the contest is an 8v4 encounter, as the
central players may pass to each other and to the
“window” players on their team.

This exercise may be helpful in teaching body
position and the shaping of runs if the coach
focuses his/her coaching points on how the central
players move to get open to receive passes from
each other and from the window players. The coach
will thus focus his/her coaching points on opening
one’s hips to the field, on bending runs away from
defenders, and on looking over one’s shoulder to
get a sense of pressure as one runs to the ball so
one knows how to position one’s body to take a
first touch away from pressure or into open space.

The second exercise or training session to improve
player runs and body positioning is one Tony
DiCicco demonstrated at the NSCAA Convention
several years ago. It is a “mandatory two-touch”
passing and receiving session, usually utilizing a
space of 25 yards long and 44 yards wide. The
number and organization of players is usually

1

2

3


_Shaping Runs Off the Ball_

_Techniques  Tactics 59_

4v4+2 or 5v5+2, with the “plus” players always
playing on the attack (Diagram # 4). When Tony
taught this session at the convention, he indicated
that he had used it with the women’s national
team, playing 9v9+2 in the penalty area. This
training idea can be used with a number of teams,
primarily at the high school and college levels, but
also including an advanced team of 10-year-olds.
Often the players will need more space in which to
operate successfully in this exercise.

The key to this session is that players must take
two touches on each possession of the ball – not
one, not three, but two. The idea is that players
must be able to position their bodies in such a way
as to be able to see the field and know where to
take their first touch so they are taking that first
touch away from pressure and/or into a space that
allows penetration of the opposing defense. In the
first stage of this progressive session, players must
stop the ball on their second touch on the end line
to score. In the second stage, players must stop
the ball in the “end zone,” with the ball entering
the zone first. This simulates through passes in a
match. In the third stage, players stop the ball in
the end zone to score, but now the player must go
in the end zone before the ball, which simulates
finding target players in a match. In both stage 2
and stage 3, no more than one attacker and one
defender may be in the end zone at any one time.

There are innumerable examples of how this
exercise can be used to teach body shape, but let
us mention just a few in this context. First, players
in advance of the ball, because they have such a
short field to work with, will need to check back to
the ball at an angle so they can see the field and
be able to take their first touch in any direction
(Diagram # 5). Second, players at the back of the
team will need to open their hips forward, rather
than to the side of the ball, so that they can either
change the point of attack or take a first touch
into a pocket, or “seam,” in the defense (Diagram
6). Third, because space is at a premium, as the

4

5

ball moves from one flank into the center, players
on the opposite flank will be most successful in
opening up the field if they bend their runs away
from the person passing them the ball before that
person actually receives the ball (Diagram # 7).

The third exercise can evolve into a full training
session and is a favorite of Jeff Tipping, NSCAA’s
Director of Coaching Development. The space for
this session is a field of 72 yards in length, marked
off into 18-yard segments, and at least 60 yards
in width, though the field could be as wide as 70
yards for older players. The basic organization of
the session involves both teams having five players

in their own defensive half of the field, including
a goalkeeper defending a full-size goal, and three
players in their attacking half of the field (Diagram
8). The lines that are 18 yards from the goal

constitute both the top of the penalty area and
offside lines.

The first stage of this session is a possession game,
with teams scoring points by playing the ball
from the five to the three and back to the five.
The players in the group of three are limited to a
maximum of three touches on any one possession
(Diagram # 9). This stage has tremendous value
for teaching body shape and positioning. The back
five, for example, must always be looking to shape
their bodies in ways that accomplish multiple ends:
maintaining possession; being able to play forward
when defenders are not in the path of a pass; and
being able to take penetrating touches forward
when defenders have been split apart from each
other. The front three, in order to be successful,
must be checking away from the back five in such a
way that they can run to the ball at an angle when
a player in the back five looks up and indicates that
he/she can play the ball forward. Then they must
check to the ball in such a way as to be able to lay
the ball off to a different player in the back five
who may be more open than the original passer.

_Shaping Runs Off the Ball_

_Techniques  Tactics 61_

In the second stage of this contest, goals are now
scored by the front three scoring on the large goal
(Diagram # 10). All players on the field, however,
remain limited to their own halves of the field. An
obvious benefit here is teaching the front three
to play numbers-down, as they would often do in
a match in the attacking third of the field. Body
shape and angling of runs take on exceptional
importance when a group is numbers-down in
attack. Learning to make simple yet creative runs in
tight spaces will help the front three exploit limited
space in match situations.

The third stage of this training allows one player
from the back five to come forward to join the front
three after the back five have passed the ball across
the half-field line (Diagram # 11). The most obvious
benefit of this stage for teaching body positioning
is in instructing the “runner” from the back five how
to bend and use angle runs to stretch the field wide
and unbalance the opposing defense. The fourth
stage of this session is an 8v8 match with no zonal
restrictions, and with the offside lines remaining 18
yards from each goal (does anyone remember this
feature of the NASL?).

There are undoubtedly many other ways for coaches
to teach players to improve their body shape and
the angle of their runs in the flow of play; these

are simply three of my favorites. Regardless of how
we teach this subject, it is apparent that American
players continue to need significant coaching in
this aspect of attacking soccer. Coaches will need
patience and players will need clear pictures and
positive reinforcement from coaches if we are to
improve our players’ tactical awareness in this
essential component of the game.

## Receiving? .................................................................................................................................................................

Be ready, be on your toes,
have your feet positioned, be balanced, and know what
to do with the ball

Wayne Harrison

The best players understand the importance
of correct preparation of both the feet and the
body when receiving the ball. The coach can
develop this awareness by using fast footwork
drills, coordination drills and speed training. Here,
Wayne Harrison offers insight into his Awareness
Training Method.

P

reparing the body, especially the feet, to
receive the ball, to be balanced and to know
what to do with the ball before receiving it are all
among the most important components players
must learn to be successful. And all of this must
happen before the player even touches the ball.

Coaches work endlessly on what the players do
when they have the ball at their feet but seem to
ignore what players must do before they get the
ball. So many players stand flat-footed with their
head down and their body closed that they can’t
help but make a bad first touch and give the
ball away.

Players need to be light on their feet, to be on their
toes and ready to receive the ball. They also must
have an open body stance so they have directional
options, and they must know their decision-making
options in advance of the ball before they can
move quickly and efficiently.

This is critical for all players, for example, in
a game in which they are closed down quickly
by an opponent and need to have the correct

foot preparation, thought awareness, and body
positioning to get out of trouble with the right
pass, run or dribble. But coaches spend little time
on this important part of training.

Awareness training, fast footwork and coordination
training go hand in hand. It is the link of the body
and the mind. Coaches need to get the players to
the stage where they instinctively “prepare their
feet” to move and open up their body, where they
see what to do before they receive the ball, where
their first touch has an added purpose; not just
simply to control the ball, but to control the ball
to enable them to make their next movement
successfully. This skill is critical whether the player
wants to play a one-touch pass, a one-touch into
space or one toward a teammate, then a pass (a
two-touch pass in other words), or to run with it,
dribble with it, cross it, receive and turn with it, or
shoot with it.

This type of training is about making the right
decisions at the right time while melding the
body and mind. The objective of this training is to
help the player receive and pass the ball quickly
and effectively. This requires excellent footwork to
decrease the time it takes to control the ball and
maintain possession of it. The awareness method
of training deals with the psychological aspect;
the footwork is the transference and connection to
this, initially without the ball, but ultimately with
the ball.


_Receiving?_

_Techniques  Tactics 63_

All training is match specific. The Awareness
Training Method is based upon developing a
balance between ball handling and functional
running and sprinting in combination with
jumping, stopping and turning.

Changing stride length exercises will be
especially important. Repetition of the exercises
is important throughout the season on a weekly
basis to develop good and correct habits regarding
coordination, comfort in running, awareness of the
efficient use of arms and legs in running and the
synchronization of limbs. With this type of training,
the intent is to develop a sixth sense in the players
by teaching the players to use the right techniques
at the right times.

The application of body coordination and speed
work is particularly important in the 6 to 12 age
group and will go hand in hand with an increased
amount of technical skills training that leads into
the Awareness Training Method of development.

General observations on running indicate the
player’s need to be able to adjust the stride
length with ease in any situation and be able
to adjust and vary the length of stride as the
particular match situation dictates. When running,
long strides mean less contact with the ground so
the player is more easily knocked off the ball and
unbalanced. It is better for the player to adjust the
way he/she runs with shorter, quicker strides so
there is more contact with the ground, less chance
to be knocked off balance, and there is a greater
chance that the feet are in the correct position
when and where they need to be to receive the ball.
Quick feet are essential for a player to be successful
at soccer. Learning to use a shorter stride length on
starting means the player gets away quicker.

Far too many players play flat-footed; they do not
get their feet in place early enough or at all to
run, change direction, or particularly to receive
the ball and be able to control it with comfort and

_64 The Best of Soccer Journal_

big problem. It is about improving balance, foot
coordination and speed.

Five to ten minutes of every session should be
devoted to practicing this footwork at pace,
without the ball. Then incorporate the ball as the
players’ skills improve.

The following routines are examples of circuits of
cones that can be laid out to help players develop
the aforementioned talent.

Fast footwork and coordination

To develop the Awareness Training Method in
players, the coach must address the positioning of
the players‘ feet before they have their first touch.
Hence, the first session plan is focused on fast
footwork. As with all the session plans, the session
will finish with a small-sided scrimmage to ensure
the players get to play with the ball but the focus
for this session is work without the ball and before
they receive it with their first touch.

Basic foot movement in and out of the cones is
the best place to begin because it is easy for the
players to have success, and it gives the players an
idea of what you (the coach) are trying to teach

them. Below are different set ups designed to
achieve this end.

- Three lines of players are in front of one of
    the lines of cones. The players run through
    the cones as fast as possible, changing stride
    lengths (as dictated by the cones) and staying
    on their toes for fast feet. Finish over the final
    five yards with a sprint (Diagram # 1).
- Begin with each player going one at a time,
    one behind the other without putting them
    under too much pressure. Have them do it
    slowly to get the rhythm. If they do it quickly,
    they may miss cones, and that would defeat
    the object of following the circuit set up and
    getting each step right.
- Develop: Once they are getting good at this,
    you can have two lanes of the same circuit set
    up and have a competitive race between two
    players. They must make sure they do all the
    foot movements correctly and do not miss
    any.
- Add new circuits to the session plan. Below
    are several different ideas you can use to
    keep the players focused during the session.
    (Diagram #s 2-5)
- Add a second circuit side by side so it is a race.
    Design your own circuits as long as the stride
    lengths and angles of movement are different
    to force the players to change their feet.
- Five to ten minutes of every session should be
    devoted to practicing this footwork at pace,
    without the ball. As their skills improve, add a
    soccer ball.
- Quick feet are essential for a player to be
    successful at soccer. Players must step between
    the cones with quick feet. The following
    routines are examples of circuits of cones that
    can be laid out to help the players develop
    this talent.

emphasizing the importance of the

first step (Diagram # 6)

- Lots of quick-standing starts emphasize the
    importance of the first stride (emphasize also
    a short step). This is the most important stride
    as it is the explosive one to move quickly. In
    this routine, the players practice many of these.
    A player at each cone. The theme is a quick
    start and sprint and a quick stop. There must
    be a pronounced stop between runs as we are
    working on that explosive start. They all sprint
    forward one cone on command from the coach

and stop quickly. Turn and sprint back together
on command. Always run the way you are
facing. First group just sprints and stops.

- Sprint forward one cone and stop but face the
    same way. The next command is to turn quickly
    and sprint back.
- Sprint to the side by turning at 45 degrees
    and sprinting.
- Jog backwards then turn at pace and sprint.
- Sprint to any cone; it can be a diagonal run
    now. Who is last? This is good for spatial
    awareness too. Where is the free cone?
- Sprint to two cones and stop at the second,
    sprint to three cones and stop at the third.

Change direction now but have them stand still
at each cone for a fraction of a second so their
next first stride is from a standing start.

Free running in a grid working
on the quick explosive start
(Diagram # 7)

- Let it go free now. Players can move
    anywhere. This now involves the players using
    anticipation, decision making, reaction and
    perception as well as coordination and fast feet
    to find space to move into without bumping
    into people.
- Peripheral vision development is starting to be
    introduced without the ball.
- Usual coach commands can be “start” and
    “stop” so they are practicing acceleration,
    deceleration, and lateral movement all in the
    one exercise.
- You can also use the commands “turn,” “jump”
    (for a header), “check,” “sit down,” and so on
    for which they have to do a short sprint after
    the command then stop on the call “stop.”

Variation on free running in a grid
(Diagram # 8)

- Introduce balls and cones to the area.
- Players jog with a ball in and out of the
    cones until the coach commands a sequence
    of events. Players have to sprint and touch
    the cones or balls with their hands. Once the
    sequence is completed, they continue jogging.
- Variations:
    - Ball only once (as above)
    - Cone only once
    - Ball then cone once each

Developing fast feet with a fun

game (Diagram # 9)

- Up to 5 players in a group with one of the
    players in the middle (could be three on the
    outside in a triangle, for example). Outside

players need to pass the ball to another player.
At the same time, try to hit the player in the
middle below the knees with the ball.

- This forces the middle player to move their feet
    quickly and be well balanced and mobile. It
    is just a fun warm-up game for players to get
    them moving and focusing on fast feet and
    coordination.
- (3) Tries to hit (4) in the middle and (4) moves
    quickly out of the way. (2) Moves on the
    outside also to get possession of the ball. (2)
    Can try again to hit (4) or, as in this example,
    pass the ball to (1) for (1) to try, passing to (5)
    as a consequence of trying to hit (4).
       - The area can be as big or small as you like;
          smaller means the player in the middle has less
          time to get out of the way and thus must be
          quicker. Maybe start up to 10 by 10 yards then
          reduce it to 5 by 5 yards, as they get better
          at it.
       - Encourage players to pass quickly and
          accurately, making it hard work for the middle
          player. Rotate the players.

## Team Techniques ....................................................................................................................................................

Craig Brown
Scottish National Team coach

The former Scottish National Team coach is a
frequent clinician at the NSCAA Convention. Here
is a session that Coach Brown offered in his most
recent visit at the 2009 convention in St. Louis.

Passing

P

layers are positioned as shown in four squads
with a ball at two diagonally opposite groups.
The front players take a touch and then play a
weighted pass (1) across to each other. They move
forward and, on receiving the other ball, pass it (2)
to the front player of the facing group then follow
their pass to the back of the facing group. The
receiving player at the front of the opposite line
passes the ball (3) to the new front player in the
original starting position. The activity then resumes
as before. Later, the exercise can be attempted at
increased speed and with one touch only. Then, to
encourage left foot passes, the exercise should be
done starting at the two other groups.

Shooting

The shooting activity begins the same as the
passing exercise above with an exchange of balls
(1) from diagonally opposite front players. The next
pass to the same front player of the facing line is a
lay-off (2) to enable the receiving player to dribble
forward (3) and shoot (4).

After shooting, either the player or goalkeeper
plays the ball to the side of the squad on his right
where other spare balls should be located. This
helps to ensure that the exercise flows without
interruption. He then joins the end of the opposite
squad in the passing activity.

Crossing and Finishing

A further progression moves the activity into a
“crossing and finishing” exercise. The first pass is an
exchange (1) as above. Then, instead of laying the

(^1) ball off inside, it is played wide (2) for the receiving
2


_Team Techniques_

_Techniques  Tactics 69_

player from the front of the opposite group. Having
played the ball out for the “winger,” the player
who initiated the exercise moves forward as a
striker to finish the cross from the other squad. The
winger dribbles (3) the ball into a wide position
before crossing (4) for the striker’s finish (5). After
shooting, the player joins the end of the squad
straight and opposite from where he started (6).

The new front players take another ball and
recommence the activity with the opening
diagonal pass.

Center Goal Game

The game is played 4v4 with the possession 4
starting at the cone 35 yards from the goal. They
play against 2 outfield defenders and two other
defenders who must remain on the goal line. The
goal is designated with two corner flags as shown
in Diagram # 4. In order to control the start of the
play, it is a good idea to have all 4 players do an
exercise (i.e., 3 press ups) before they start playing.
The 4v2 exercise should result in a goal attempt
after which all 4 defenders take the ball to their
starting cone on the other side of the center goal.
The defending team changes the 2 defenders with
2 “goalkeepers.” The coaching opportunities in the
4v2 activity are limitless, and it is suggested that

there is no defined width in the playing area. Play
naturally comes back to the focal area — the goal
that is being attacked!

The (real) goalkeepers may be introduced from the
beginning or after the players have played for a
time with 2 defenders in goal. When the ‘keepers
are in goal the 2 from the goal line move to the
cone behind the goal and rest in preparation to be
joined by their colleagues who are defending the
goal line as the two defenders in the 4v2.

Shaping a Team in a 4-4-2

Activity #1

Set up: 8v4 Cross Running
This is an 8v4 exercise with the middle 4 players
playing in both directions. For fitness work, it can
be used on a full-sized field, but the penalty box
to penalty box distance can be equally demanding
and better for teaching.

Instructions
Shown in the Diagram # is the middle team
playing north and south with the red team. When
the attack is over, either by a successful attack
or the defending team winning possession and

3 4


_70 The Best of Soccer Journal_

playing the ball back to their ‘keeper or putting
it out of play, the middle 4 players change places
at speed as shown, A with C and B with D.
The game resumes on the signal of the coach
when the change of positions has been undertaken
successfully. The blue – whites play with the gray.
After a 10-minute period of hard work, the middle
4 players change with one of the other “teams” of 4.

Coaching Points
When playing in the other direction, the middle
players change positions — SPRINTING — wide
right, A changing with C, and B changing with
D. The ‘keeper holds the ball until the change is
complete.

Activity #2

Set up: Shaping a Team In a 4-4-2 Formation
Using the 70-yard field, teams are set up in three
colors. On either end there is a back four and two
strikers. In addition, there is a middle four playing
with both teams.

Instructions
The 10v6 game is started by a throw-out from one
goalkeeper who initiates the nature of the play
specified by the coach (i.e., up, back, and through
with center striker). The back four – reds — of this

team operates with the — white /blue — middle
four and their own two strikers against the back
four and two strikers of the opposition – the
gray team. This numerical superiority should result
in a successful attack. On winning the ball, the
defenders should attempt to pass back to their
goalkeeper or clear up field or out of play. They
do not initiate an attack, or counter attack at this
time. The coach controls the exercise.

Coaching Points
The defending team, supplemented by the neutral
midfield players (who could have changed to their
own positions prior to the new movement), now
play against the original six. The game proceeds
from end to end allowing the coach to make
relevant points and introduce attacking and
defending set piece arrangements.

## Developing Passing Skills – 5v2

Dave Nicholas

D

rill: Five players arrange themselves in a
circle, approximately 10 yards in diameter.
The size of the circle will vary depending on the
players’ ages and abilities. Within the circle are
two defenders. The five players should play one
or two-touch passing while attempting to keep
the ball away from the two defenders. The offensive
player who makes a mistake (i.e., ball out of area,
too much pace on the ball, failing to control the
ball) changes places with the defender who has
been in the middle the longest. The first pass is always
free, thus assuring that the drill gets underway.

This is a drill that can be used in warm-up,
but initially there must be some instruction.
Following are some of the coaching points that
need to be covered either in initial instruction or in
subsequent practices.

Near Support: The players on either side of the
player in ball possession are most important. They
must be in a correct position for support by the
time the player passed to receives the ball.

Do not wait until he receives it! Anticipate! The
supporting players should almost be in a square
position to support, while being as close as their
skills will allow (Diagram # 1). The proximity
of the defender is a consideration in terms of
distance. Such positioning will result in a good
many square passes, which are possession passes.
Possession is one objective of this game.

Far Support: While the near-supporting players are
trying to disrupt the defensive arrangement with
quick, short passing, the plays on the far side of
the circle are looking for the best position “away”
from the ball that will allow for a pass to come
to them between the two defenders. This drill

builds the ability for the players to combine for
the penetrating ball. In Diagram # 1, we see that
A1 has opened up for the ball, illustrating this
principle.

For this to take place, the 2-3 players in close
support are involved with quick, short passes. 3-5
passes will hopefully lead to penetrating pass
opportunities. More passes will allow the two
defenders to concentrate their efforts into a small
space and deny the penetrating pass. Also, small
spaces tend to limit play by the attackers, with
play becoming very predictable. As the longer,
penetrating pass is made, the two players closest to
the receiver immediately take up their close support
once more and try to repeat the same rhythm.

Rhythm: Players ignore half of the field. This is
evident in this exercise. If a player is receiving a
ball from the right and his back is turned to the
left half of the circle, he has cut his options in half.
He must “front” the whole circle, opening up his
body position so that he can see all of his possible

passing outlets (Diagram # 2).
Feinting: In the previous example, the player will
probably have to play the ball back to the right,
thus being predictable. If he faces the entire circle,
he could go left or right. With a quick foot, hip
or shoulder movement in one direction (properly
timed), he could unbalance the defender and play
the ball in either direction.

Technique: Obviously, various aspects of passing
are going to emerge. The ball must be played
behind a supporting player, and subsequently lost,
which means the player making the pass becomes
a defender. Passes should be properly weighted.
The strength of the pass is a judgment to be made
by the passer. Again, if the ball is hit with too
much strength (speed), it is the player of the ball
who takes the middle of defense. Finally, players
should strive for variety in their passing, using
different parts of their feet. This lends itself to
feinting and quicker foot movement, with resultant
greater speed and anticipation in the 5v5 game.

Other Coaching Considerations

- Use players who play around each other
    (strikers-midfielders; midfielders-backs: right
    side, central or left-sided players) together in 5v2.
- Make competitions out of the game (most

penetrating passes in groups in five minutes).

- Use keepers as middle two defenders (with rest).
- Limit to one touch.
- Let the game move its location, with no stoppages
    for switching of attackers, to middle with play
    continuous but with a limit of a 10-yard radius in
    effect as the group moves about.

Quick Feet (5v2): Because of the limitation of
space in this drill, you will begin to identify the
better players on your team just through the use
of this drill. Almost without fail, the poorer players
will find themselves in the middle, defending
against the ball. Part of the problem may lie
in technique (poor control on reception or poor
control in passing). Also it may be as a result of
poor decision-making.

But players must build more time for decision-
making by improving their “speed”: playing speed
in this case. The faster the control can take place,
the more time is on hand to decide which passing
technique to apply to the particular defensive
problem to be overcome. So in control, passing
(and dribbling), and quickness of feet is important.

I have a couple of favorite ways of developing this
particular area of concern. The first practice has
nothing to do with the 5v2 exercises. However it can
serve as an indicator of the level and the improvement
of quickness, as well as helping indirectly to improve
the level of play in the 5v2 exercises.

Start with one foot on the ground, bearing one’s
weight, and the ball of the other foot touching
the top of the soccer ball. With a hopping motion,
switch feet. Continue to repeat this movement.
Everything must be done on the balls of the feet.
Don’t let the players get back on their heels.
Demand speed with this drill. I have found that
high school players should be able to touch the
ball 90-120 times in 30 seconds if concentrating.
Times can be varied in this drill, with limits of
10-30 seconds. Drilling longer than 30 seconds
brings muscle fatigue that spoils the technique.

_Techniques  Tactics 73_

Continually using this technique in practice will
stimulate the neurological pathways necessary to
improve quickness.

We can also work on quickness by implementing a
condition on the exercise. Every player must touch
the ball twice every time it comes to them – no
more, no less. After the player touches the ball
once, a split-second will elapse before the second
touch is possible. Strive to reduce the time between
touches. By adding the mandatory second touch,
the player’s time and space is reduced. A defender
now has a split-second longer to close down the
player in possession.

The major fault of the players in this exercise is
that they kill or stop the ball on the first touch.
They must redirect the ball with the first touch,
while maintaining the ball with their own space.
However, here it is important to remember that
feinting comes into play. He can play the ball back
to the right (depending on the defender’s position)
with the inside of the left foot, the outside of the
right foot, or he can back heel it.

Decision-Making: In the last example, which part
of the foot is used? Which pass is made? Before a
player is able to constantly make correct decisions,
he must have certain tools at his disposal. We, as
coaches, must give the players the opportunity
to practice the types of passes being discussed.
Without acquiring these skills, players will lack the
necessary confidence to quickly enact a decision.
Also striving to improve quickness of feet allows
players more time to analyze the situation and
make the correct choice. (More time sometimes
means a fraction of a second; sometimes that is
all that is necessary.) We must encourage players
to “observe” the field while the ball is in motion.
Upon receiving the ball, decision-making is made
easier as the brain has already “taken” several
pictures and has made a decision as to what is
the best pass to make in relation to teammates’
positions and the alignment of the defense.

Again, a coach can perhaps spot, in the 5v2 game,
those players who have trouble with making the
right decision – usually they have trouble with
making the right decision — usually they are in the
middle! By reviewing the players’ options in the
5v2 game, the coach can begin to appreciate their
thought process and help the player to make more
correct passing decisions.

Changing Decisions: Sometimes a “mind set” is
developed by the player, but because of the speed
of the game, it is no longer in effect as the ball
approaches the player. In any case, even if the
decision is changed by circumstances, the player
must move to the ball. He can then use a second
touch of feinting or both to buy time for a new
decision to emerge. By demanding that a player
move to the ball, the first rule of ball possession is
instilled in 5v2.

Reading the Game: After viewing your team
playing the game for several practices, you will
see that they all perceive the game differently.
Unfortunately, perception is one area of the game
that is innate. It can be improved but not as
readily as other aspects of the game. By improving
the concentration of players and working on their
anticipation, a coach can perhaps overcome the
lack of a player’s innate ability to “read the game.”

Concentration: This is an area of the game that can
be improved by 80%. To improve concentration,
we must give players very specific tasks. In the
5v2 exercises, we can diversify the demands of
concentration by imposing different conditions but
only one at a time. Examples would be: one-touch
passing, two-touch passing, five passing equal one
goal, all passes with the outside of the foot, etc.
In other words, players are not just playing but
improving their concentration levels.

Anticipation: Anticipation is yet another area that
can be drastically improved. Experience is certainly
a factor in the development of anticipation, but
one can begin to train players to Feinting their own

movements and look for cues from the opponent’s
movements.

We have thus far only examined the offensive
principles underlying the exercise. However, in
order to create a realistic challenge for the five
offensive players, the two defensive players must
be taught their individual roles and responsibilities,
as well as how to function in tandem.

Pressure: As soon as the first “free” pass is made,
it is essential that one of the two defenders
put pressure on the player in possession. If no
pressure is applied, the player in possession and
his immediate support should play a series of short
passes until a defender is drawn to them. There
should be no “diving in” or overcommitment unless
there is a guarantee that the ball will be won. In
fact, in this particular exercise, defenders should
utilize all their tactical plays to win the ball and, if
possible, remain on their feet throughout.

In approaching an opponent who has the ball, a
defender must be ready to “check” his forward rush
and momentum abruptly. Just as his opponent, the
defender is trying to leave open various options
in order to instill some decision-making in the
mind of the attacker, for if he is unsure of the
defender’s next movement, the game is suddenly
more difficult. The defender can fake a tackle,
he can follow the pass, or he can anticipate and
intercept the pass.

Angle-Distance: Two considerations at this
point are:

- How close do we get to the player in
    possession?
- What is our angle of approach? Distance
    is dependent on the defender’s and/or
    attacker’s ability.

However, the defender should be close enough
to tackle in case of poor control by the attacker
and close enough to prevent/intercept a forward
pass. (This is usually in the region of the 4-6 feet

from the attacker.) In approaching the player,
the defender must be examining his position by
considering several factors: Where is his covering
player located? What is the relative strength of
the attacking players, i.e., which are the weaker
players? In which direction does he anticipate the
play to move? Which are the attackers’ good feet?
In general, we might state that if the defender
approaches the attacker straight on, the attacker
has the option of playing to either his right or left.
We must therefore teach the defender to “shepard” or
“channel” play in the direction we want the play to go.

Cover: What is the role of the second defender?
The one thing the defenders are trying to prevent
is the “through ball,” i.e., the pass played between
the two defenders. The second defender therefore
should not mark an opponent as he would present
a “square/flat” formation (Diagram # 3), and while
his partner pressures an opponent, he must provide
cover (Diagram # 4).

Again, the question arises; how far behind the
pressuring defender and at what angle does the
second defender play? In terms of distance, the
abilities of the players have to be taken into
consideration. In a normal game, the second player
should be close enough to intercept/tackle the

3


_Developing Passing Skills – 5v2_

_Techniques  Tactics 75_

onrushing attacker. In our particular exercise, where
there is no attacker dribbling, we still want to train
the covering defender to be aware of this aspect of
distance. In general, he should be 6-8 feet behind
the pressuring defender. In looking at the covering
angle, several aspects are considered, but above all,
a “through ball” must not be allowed.

In Diagram # 5, the pressuring defender has
assumed a straight-on approach. The second
defender has overplayed slightly to the left, and
the ball will probably be played to A3. In Diagram
# 6, the pressuring defender has overplayed to the
left, with the covering defender playing slightly to
the right. Again, the ball will probably be played
to A3. In Diagram # 7, both will again probably be
played to A3.

Remember, in stating that the ball will “probably”
be played in a certain direction, the game of soccer
is a game of “cat and mouse,” where the attacker
is aware of the defender’s ploys and is trying to do
other than the expected and vice versa.

The difference between Diagram # 5 and 6 is that
C, the pressuring defender, will move with the
pass to A3 as he is the nearest defender while in
Diagram # 6, the covering defender is closer so
he is the one to apply the pressure to A3 with the
other defender now assuming the covering role.

Communication: In this exercise, communication
is vital, especially in the early stages. Players may
eventually play more instinctively once they are
more familiar with the tactics of the game and
their teammates. However, for the time being, the
covering defender, in general, should be “talking”
to the pressuring defender.

Note: If you are working on defensive principles, do
not play one-touch passing, as defenders will not
have time to pressure and cover and therefore the
coach will not have the opportunity to correct.

Anticipation: We also now refer back to
anticipation. Let us look at Diagram # 7 again

4 5

_76 The Best of Soccer Journal_

(it could apply to 5 & 6 as well). If A2 looks up
and sees both players overlapping on the same
side, he will probably play A3. But this could be a
deliberate ploy by the covering defender. For once
A2’s head goes down and his foot initiates the
backswing motion, the covering defender is already
moving toward A3. This early movement by the
covering defender should always take place before
A3 receives the ball. The difference in time may
be all an attacker needs to shoot or play a forward
pass in a game. In this case, the covering defender
has deliberately set up this play and is anticipating
the next move.

Decision-Making: Just as the defenders are trying
to outwit attackers, the opposite is also true.
With this in mind, defenders must never challenge
with only one option in mind. They must have a
back-up plan should the attacker do something
unpredictable. As was discussed earlier, a short,
but very valuable amount of time passes before
a second option can be initiated and enacted.
However, the process can be sped up if the back-
up option has already been initiated and is ready
should the primary option be discarded.

In continuing the last notion, the pressuring
defender can reach out with one leg to block a
lateral pass by the attacker, but he must be ready

to recoil and assume a good defensive position if
the attacker is faking a pass and brings the ball
back to the other side.

Other Versions

6v2 (Diagram # 8)
The placement of the players is the same as that
for the 5v2 exercises, with the addition of an extra
attacking player who plays within the circle of five.
The outer players still become defenders should
they make an error, but the designated middle
attacker stays in for a specific period of time,
regardless of errors.

8v3
Seven attackers form a circle (approximately 25
yards across) with three defenders inside the circle,
as in the previous exercise.

Note: In any of these exercises, the coach can
select the size of the playing area. This size will be
determined by the age and ability of the players,
plus the specific objective of the exercise.

By adding the “inside” attacker, in both 6v2 and
8v3, the exercises become more position-related.

7

_Developing Passing Skills – 5v2_

_Techniques  Tactics 77_

The inside player can offer constant close support
to the player in possession, i.e., play as a midfielder.
On the other hand, the player may position himself
away from the ball and, playing as a striker, “show”
himself at the approximate support angle, but
more distant than in the previous example.

Open Play

Another variation allows a ball that has gone
outside the area to be played back into the area
with a one-touch pass by the attackers. The
defenders can, however, intercept this return pass.

Summary: While 5v2 is fun and a simple warm-up,
it is an exercise that initially demands that all the
principles and subtle tactics involved in the game
be taught. Thereafter, the development of the
game and the fun involved is as far-reaching as the
players’ imagination and creativity.

## Dribbling ...................................................................................................................................................................

Frans Van Balkom

M

illions of people all over the world of
different races, backgrounds, and cultures
have one thing in common – love and passion for
the great game of soccer. Why is this?

One reason is that soccer can be tremendously
exciting for players and spectators alike! A player
is challenged in many ways during the game. He
must make numerous decisions, has to be creative,
and can express himself totally when playing.
Spectators play the game mentally. The numerous
tactical possibilities and the great skills of the
players make watching a game, at a high level
between two competitive teams, a very exciting
affair. Even though soccer is a team sport, the
success or failure of the team depends a great deal
on the individual performances of the players.

In no other sport are more skills needed and
displayed than in soccer. The one skill that excites
spectators more than any is the art of dribbling. A
dribbler uses individual dribbling skills combined
with feinting, coordination, speed, timing,
creativity, and surprise when taking on opponents.

One player who is one of the best examples of that
and whose dribbling skills and style of play are
admired all over the world is the great Argentinean
player Diego Maradonna. His dribbling skills
were masterfully demonstrated in the ’86 Mexico
World Cup, especially in Argentina’s games versus
England and Belgium when he dribbled past their
entire defenses and scored. Since the early days of
soccer, spectators have been fascinated by great
dribblers in action. Players like Northern Ireland’s
George Best, the Dutch player Johan Cruyff, Brazil’s
Garrincha, the Spanish player Gento, and the
most famous of all, the Englishman Sir Stanley
Matthews. Matthews was knighted by the Queen

of England for the role he played in promoting
soccer and sportsmanship. He still played soccer
at the highest professional level until late in his
40s‘, exciting spectators and players alike with his
dazzling runs and great finishing passes.

In soccer, various methods can be used to create
an opening to get behind an opponent’s defense,
but nothing is more exciting than watching a
player using dribbling skills to take on defenders
to create an opening for himself or set up a scoring
opportunity for his teammates.

Dribblers have always played a big part in the
attacking game but never before has there been
more need and demand for players who have the
individual skills and ability to take on defenders
than in today’s game!

Today’s Packed Defenses

The reason for this is that most teams are very
defense-oriented and, once ball possession is lost,
they fall back into their own half of the field en
masse. Once they start to apply pressure, they
press the man with the ball and the supporting
players around the ball, making it very difficult
for attackers to find room for either a pass or
a dribble. Under such conditions, playing the
ball successfully behind the opponent’s defense
is almost impossible. Short combinations become
more and more difficult once the opponent starts
to apply pressure.
A team that has the players with the skills
to shield and play the ball around until the
opponent’s defense is fairly disorganized now
needs a player with the ability to take on defenders
to create an opening.


_Dribbling_

_Techniques  Tactics 79_

In many games, teams that dictate play and attack
almost non-stop lose because they cannot find
a way to create openings in the opponent’s wall
of defenders. More and more of their players
are pushed up to join the attack and, when ball
possession is suddenly lost, the opponent then
finds plenty of space to successfully counterattack
and sometimes score!

Despite the fact that there is a tremendous need for
players who can deal with tight marking defenses,
there are hardly any dribblers around. Why is this?
A number of reasons can be suggested. Some of
them include:

- Dribblers and generally skillful players suffer
    because of the excessive physical play, which
    has been brought into the game. Luckily
    everyone is starting to realize the importance
    of good skillful players and excessive, vicious
    play is no longer tolerated.
- The tactical team concept of “play safe, don’t
    lose ball possession,” has led to boredom and
    is partly to blame for creating players who

are very predictable and lack dribbling and
attacking skills.

- Another important factor is that the game at
    high levels has changed tactically, especially
    from a defensive point of view. Much more
    pressure is put on the player with the ball,
    especially when inside the opponent’s
    defensive half of the field. Being pressured
    by two or three players at once is normal and
    opportunities to pass off near the ball are hard
    to find.
- But, most damaging of all, there are many
    coaches who only seem to be concerned about
    having a winning team. In many cases, players
    are discouraged to take on players or even
    forbidden to do so, because of the risk of
    possibly losing the ball.
- Lastly, the lack of knowledge on the coach’s
    part regarding development of skills plays a
    major role.

Principles of Coaching
Individual Skills

Volunteer youth coaches cannot be praised enough
for the time and effort they spend helping young
people in their general soccer development.
However, they could achieve much better results,
especially in regard to developing individual skills
(including dribbling), if they would coach according
to the following principles:

- The coach must be able to demonstrate the
    skills and moves.
- The coach must understand how to develop
    and build up a dribbling program in
    combination with other skills.
- Allow/encourage players to use dribbling
    moves in practice and in games.
- Demand that players be creative and use
    dribbling moves in games.
- Teach players a number of different dribbling
    moves. This will help them select the moves
    they feel confident with and which they can

_80 The Best of Soccer Journal_

use successfully in realistic game situations. A
player who has the ability to regularly use two
or three different moves successfully in games
is a big asset to the team.

- The dribbler must have the full approval of the
    coach in regard to dribbling.
- The best age to develop skills is 11-14 years
    old.
- Learning dribbling skills must be part of every
    player’s general basic skill training program.
- Young players who show that they possess the
    basic fundamentals to become exceptionally
    good dribblers should be given all possible
    support and encouragement.
- When developing a player’s dribbling skill,
    the coach must, at the same time, develop
    the player’s tactical knowledge. Once he has
    mastered the moves, he must learn when and
    when not to take on players. All dribbling
    actions must be in the best interest of the team
    and be part of the team concept. Discipline
    and tactical awareness are vitally important
    and must be demanded and taught by the coach.

Dribbling

In the eyes of opponents, successful dribblers are
very unpredictable and are masters of the art of
feinting. A player who tries to take on (dribble)
opponents each time he has possession of the ball
becomes predictable, will frequently lose the ball,
and exposes himself to injury.

Successful dribbling actions are enhanced by the
support and behavior of the dribbler’s teammates.
A player in ball possession must have various
tactical options when in ball possession because if
opponents know that his only option and aim is to
dribble, their defensive task becomes much easier.

It is also helpful when a team is able to play the
ball around. Good support, near and off the ball,
helps a great deal in setting up players to make
good dribbling runs. A sudden action of a dribbler
catches defenders sometimes unprepared and by
switching and changing ball sides frequently, the
opponent’s defense will be stretched, and become
unbalanced and the chance for successful
dribbling occurs.

Dribblers who can create openings against tightly
packed, high-pressuring defenses are vitally
important in today’s modern game.

Dribbling Moves

There are a great number of dribbling moves –
some very simple, others complex. When using
them, they are combined with others skills, such
as feinting, shielding, etc. To dribble successfully,
speed and timing are important. A player may
learn up to 40 different moves but will usually
rely on special/favorite moves when under real
pressure. One of the most acclaimed dribblers ever,
Sir Stanley Matthews, was known for using only
one special move. He varied that move a good
deal. The move was named after him and is known
as the Matthews Move!

_Dribbling_

_Techniques  Tactics 81_

By allowing players to practice moves regularly,
their timing and feeling for when and how to
use the moves improve. To become a successful
dribbler, continuous practice and repetition of the
moves is very important.

Everyone can learn all the moves. Some learn faster
than others, usually because of better coordination.
But not everyone can be equally successful when
using the moves. Personality, character, inborn
physical attributes like power and speed, and other
factors play a big role in how successful a player
will be as a dribbler.

A coach must know and understand each player’s
ability regarding dribbling. A good team is a
combination of various types of players, each
playing a big part in the building of a successful
team, and the coach must be aware of their strong
and weak points in order to get the best possible
results.

Move #1 – Push Left, Sprint Right
Dribble ball with right foot toward an oncoming
player. Push ball with instep of right foot past left
side of opponent (to dribbler’s right), and sprint
past his right side to collect the ball behind him.

Move #2 – Scissor
There are a number of scissor moves. The Single
Scissors, behind, over, and around the ball are some.
One of the most effective is the one around the ball
and is as follows: Dribble the ball with the right
foot toward the opponent’s right side. Step with
right foot, from the inside, around ball (the right
foot passes between the ball and the left leg goes
around the front of the ball and is planted on the
right side of the ball). Place right foot down and
play ball with outside of left foot past opponent’s
right side. Especially effective when close to
opponent as ball is shielded from the opponent.

Move #3 – Double Scissors
Dribble ball with right foot. Take a small step with
right foot toward the right, over and past ball.

Take a big step with left foot to left, past the ball,
then play ball with outside of the right foot past
opponent’s left side and accelerate.

Move #4 – Matthews Move
Start this move with a dead ball. Place left foot
next to ball and lean left. Lift right foot off the
ground and push the ball slightly inside (toward
the left) with the inside of the right foot. Then push
off with left foot and play ball with opposite of
right foot to right past opponent’s left and sprint
past him to collect ball.

Move #5 – Circle Around Ball
Dribble with right instep. Then circle with right foot
from outside (right foot moves to the right, comes
back across the front of the ball and back toward
the body) around the ball. Play the ball again with
instep or outside of right foot and accelerate.

Move #6 – Cap Under Body
Dribble with right foot. Cap ball with instep of
right foot back and toward left foot. Then play
ball with inside of left foot past right side of
opponent and accelerate.

Move #7 – Swivel
Dribble with right foot, feint cap with right foot
and drop right shoulder. Then cap ball with left
foot back and across body to right side and play
ball with inside of right foot to right side past
opponent’s left side and accelerate.

Move #8 – Pulling the V
Dribble ball with right foot at an angle toward
opponent’s right side, forcing him to step to his
right. Then pull ball with sole of right foot back
toward you, pivot on left foot and play ball with
inside of right foot to right at an angle past
defender’s left side and accelerate.

Move #9 – Outside Inside
Start moving at a slow pace. Play ball with right
foot alternating with inside – outside. Right foot
is kept off the ground and short forward hops are


_82 The Best of Soccer Journal_

made on the left foot. Ball is played with inside of
foot on outside of the ball and with outside of foot
on inside of the ball. After about 10 ball touches,
suddenly push outward, or cap ball inward, and
push off with left foot accelerating sideways and
forward (on angle), beating opponent on right or
left side.

Move #10 – Roll Off
Dribble ball with right foot, step with sole of right
foot on top of the ball and roll ball outward. Then
push the ball with the inside of the right foot
across the body to the left. Put right foot down
and play ball with outside of left foot to left past
defender’s right side and accelerate.

Methodical Build-Up of Moves

- At the beginning, all skills are learned with
    a dead or slow moving ball at a slow pace
    without any kind of pressure. Each player has
    one ball.
- Players practice moves at high pace and work
    in pairs.

Players perform same move at same time, beating
each other.

- Two players use one ball. In the beginning,

player “B” is passive (does not try to win the
ball). Later, “B” is allowed to move forward, put
pressure on “A” and attempt to win the ball
from “A”.

- Four attackers (X), each with a ball and moving
    in a counterclockwise direction, attack two
    defenders. At first, defenders are passive
    (standing); later, they may attempt to win the
    ball. Defenders, in attempting to win the ball,
    can only move to the left or right (not forward
    or backward). A defender who wins the ball
    changes place with the attacker who lost it.
- Six players – three attackers (X), three
    defenders (O). A single defender defends along

2

1 3


_Dribbling_

_Techniques  Tactics 83_

a line (5 yards) against a single attacker. O2
and O3 wait their turn by a cone at either
end of the line. After O1 defends against X1,
O2 comes in to defend against X2, etc. If the
defender wins the ball, he changes places
with the attacker. When all three attackers
have played 1v1 from one direction, they then
attack from the opposite direction.

- Combine dribbling moves with shielding and
    finishing work in restricted area 30 by 20 yards.
    3v3 and a goalie, using goal at one end and a
    line between cones on other end as targets.
    Team in attack uses individual actions and
    combinations to score a goal. When a goal is
    scored, the attacking team keeps ball possession
    and attack line between cones. When ball is
    dribbled over line, attacking team attacks goal
    again. Defenders must allow attackers 2 yards
    to come out once they dribble over line.
- 3v3 and a neutral player (Y) using two goals
    in a 30 by 20 yard confined area. Combine
    dribbling with shielding, feinting, finishing,
    and counterattack. Neutral player plays with
    team in ball possession.
- Same as #7 but neutral player plays with team
    defending.
       - One server (Y) and three attackers play vs. four
          defenders and goalie in confined area of 40 by
          30 yards.

Objectives: Attackers – Server dictates pace
and controls attack. Attackers work on actions,
ball possession, combination play, and finishing.
Stressing individual actions is especially important.
Objectives: Defense – Winning and keeping ball
possession counterattack over line. After 10
minutes, attackers change role with defenders.

Objectives: Use individual actions in combination
with feinting, shielding, finishing, and counterattack.
Also, work on slow build-up, switching sides and
pressuring.

Once players have learned and are able to use skills
at a high pace, all dribbling must be performed in
combination with all other skills in realistic game
situations. A good deal of time must be spent

during practice playing various types of games with
and without goals such as 2v2, 2v3, 3v3, 3v4, 4v5,
5v6, 8v8, and finally, players using dribbling skills
in regular 11v11 games.

## The Art of Crossing

Jeff Tipping
Former Director of Coaching NSCAA

O

f the 101 goals scored from open play in the
2006 World Cup, 46 were from restarts and
20 were scored from crosses (16 from the right and
four from the left). The FIFA goal breakdown looks
like this:

Crosses 20
Combination Play 16
Defense Splitting Passes 18
Solo Efforts 16
Diagonal into the Box 7
Exceptional Finish 11
Defensive Error 3
Rebound 8
Counter Attack 2

It is not surprising with defensive systems
becoming ever more sophisticated that attacks
frequently come from wide positions that result
in a crossed ball.

There are basically two kinds of crosses employed
from flank positions. The first, and by far the
most common these days, is the so-called “early
cross,” which is delivered from positions around
the corner of the penalty box (Diagram # 1). The
second cross is the “goal line cross” delivered from
approximately the junction of the goal line and
penalty box (Diagram # 2).

_86 The Best of Soccer Journal_

The major reason the early cross has become so
popular is due to the development of the zonal or
“flat” back four. The emergence of the flat back four
in the United States and the virtual elimination of
the sweeper system has opened up an “offside”
space between the backs and the goalkeeper when
the back line pushes up maintaining its zonaL-
shape (Diagram # 3). This is the space exploited
by the use of the early cross.

Ten or fifteen years ago, a sweeper occupied
this space (Diagram # 4) so flank players would
frequently dribble to the goal line and cross the
ball to the top of the six-yard box or the far post.
Without a sweeper occupying that space, the flank
player can now cross the ball much earlier. The
key tactical elements a flank player must take into
account in executing the early cross are:

- A clear space between the back line and the
    goalkeeper.
- The defenders have been turned and are
    moving back toward their own goal.
- The flank player is in a position where the
    ball can be delivered with the necessary
    “hook.” The closer the flank player gets to the
    goal line, the more difficult it becomes to hook
    the ball effectively.
       - The presence of forwards in and around the
          penalty box (Diagram # 5).

Hooking the Ball

Eliminating the goalkeeper is a vital aspect of any
cross. Delivering the early cross with spin or “hook”
achieves this objective. The key technical aspects in
deliver a hooking ball are:

- Striking the ball with an in-to-out motion, i.e.,
    striking the ball on the right side with the right
    foot, left side with the left foot.
- Striking the ball with the toe up. This
    contributes significantly to the hooking effect.
    Toe down will make the ball go straight.
- Hips facing forward. It is quite important that
    the player does not turn the hips in toward the
    goal too much as this will tend to deliver a
    straight ball.

The Delivery

The perfect delivery arrives in the space between
the retreating backs, attacking forwards and the
goalkeeper with spin. The perfect height is between
the player’s shin and chest. This makes it almost
impossible for the defender to easily clear the ball
and easy for the attacker to stoop or dive and head

4

_The Art of Crossing_

_Techniques  Tactics 87_

it in. Anything above the chest makes it easier for
the defender to flick the ball on into the neutral
space. If the defenders and attackers are at the
top of the penalty box, the crossing players should
deliver the ball to the space between the penalty
spot and the six-yard box, commonly called the
“second six-yard box.” (Diagram # 6).

The second six-yard box is, generally, just too far for
the goalkeeper to come out for the interception
but close enough for a forward to redirect the
ball into the goal without significant technical
demands. The crossing player is urged to deliver
the ball into the space – the emphasis is on the
forward to get into space and connect with the
ball. If forwards are slow or reticent to get into the
second six, they need to be forcefully reminded that
this is their responsibility.

Coaching Exercises (Diagram # 7)

Organization – Flank players in wide positions with
a supply of balls. The rest of the players arrange
themselves in three lines. The flank players pass
the ball forward (Pass A) to a “rebounder,” who
plays the ball back to the flank player (Pass B).
The central players begin to move forward with
bending runs. The rebounder plays ball back slowly,

and the flank player meets and hooks the ball into
the vital area (Pass C). It is easier to bend a ball
that is rolling toward you, and it is recommended
that coaches begin with this artificial condition to
ensure spin and to give players success. It is critical
that the flank players begin slowly and that the
coach carefully observes the practice to make sure
the technique is correct.

Stage 2

Adding two defenders and taking away the
“rebound” player can develop the practice further.
A cone is introduced about 10 yards outside the
penalty area and two flags are introduced in
the wide areas. In this exercise, the “rebounders”
become defenders who begin at the 10-yard cone
(Diagram # 8). The central players play the ball
to the feet of the flank players and begin their
attacking movement by moving in a pre-determined
manner. The flank attacker receives the ball and
begins dribbling forward. The key condition here is
that the defenders cannot retreat past the 10-yard
cone until the flank player physically goes past the
touchline flag. This will create a delay just long
enough to allow a space to open up behind the
back two and the crossing player can hook the
ball into the vital area (Diagram # 9). Two new

defenders rotate in on every new sequence. Repeat

- To avoid collisions, keep goalkeepers in their own
six-yard box!

the NSCAA Advanced National Diploma. To access

diplomas, visit the residential courses section of the

## Cultivating Talent in Young American Soccer .................................................................................................

_Techniques  Tactics 89_

## Cultivating Talent in Young American Soccer

Players between the ages of 7 and 13

Horst Wein

H

ere are some thought provoking ideas for
running a youth soccer program:

1. Consider the exclusive use of a number 4 ball
    for all players aged between 8 and 13 years
    in their training sessions and competitions.
    The WHO (World Health Organization) also
    demands it for health reasons, and the world
    of soccer for facilitating the young children to
    acquire technical skills and achieve a superior
    tactical learning.
2. Use the many variants of Mini Soccer with 4
    goals (instead of attacking one centralized
    goal, the ball has to be kicked in one of two
    goals, separated by no less than 12 yards)
    with the purpose of systematically stimulating
    the perception skills, a capacity that has to
    be considered as a base for correct decision-
    making and execution of technique.
       3. Regularly organize different competitions,
          tailor-made to the mental and physical
          capacities of the young kids, such as a Soccer
          Triathlon, 3-on-3 or 4-on-4, a Mini Soccer
          Pentathlon, a Goalkeeper Decathlon, a
          Decathlon for Soccer Players or a Heptathlon).
          To be able to stimulate the game intelligence
          of our young players, it is necessary to offer
          them more than a single official competition
          in one season. Competing in the same season
          in several competitions that are different from
          the traditional ones will improve their capacity
          of adaptation and their flexibility of the brain.
          In all these competitions, the participation, the
          enjoyment, the recreation and fun are more
          important aspects than winning.
       4. For children 10 and 11 years old, the season
          should be divided in two parts. In the first
          half of the season, a competition is played
          without giving points away or establishing
          a classification table. In the second part of
          the season, a championship is played with 3
          periods of 15 minutes and an interval of only
          5 minutes in which the coaches may exchange
          their commentaries with the players. Coaching
          from the sideline is forbidden.
       5. Allow substitutions in all youth competitions
          as happens in basketball, volleyball, or hockey,
          i.e., the same player may be taken off and
          return as often as the coach prefers. The
          “rolling substitution” generates within the
          group of players a much better coexistence,
          avoids overloads, and furthermore allows better

(^8) communication as the coach may take a player


_90 The Best of Soccer Journal_

off the field to give him any technical-tactical
advice.

6. In order to cultivate important but often
    forgotten aspects like “fair-play”, sport ethics
    and perfect behavior toward the opponents,
    the teammates and the referee, each team
    receives the opportunity to present to the
    referee after the end of the game one golden
    card with the name of a player written
    on it. This player always has to be named
    from the opposite side. In case nobody has
    demonstrated fine sportsmanship, no card is
    handed to the referee. At the end of each
    season, the player who received the most cards
    from the opponents is considered sportsman of
    the season.
7. To lessen the percentage of the anaerobic
    effort in a game played on the full field,
    convince the authorities to prohibit 11-a-side
    competitions for children between 7 and 13
    years. Competitions with 3, then 7 and later 8
    players on the field increases its dimensions
    the same way as the fewer players in a
    team increase technically, tactically, in their
    perception and understanding of the game.
8. Publish and diffuse sufficient teaching
    information to make sure that in each
    preparatory session the 7- to 13-year-old
    players are exposed for half an hour to
    multipurpose motor activities that improve
    their level of coordination.
9. Allow in all youth competitions between 8-
    and 13-year-old players a rule that states that
    a team that is losing with a difference of 4
    goals (0:4, 1:5, 2:6, etc.) can introduce one
    additional player into the game to force the
    winning team to continue to try hard and put
    their best efforts in.
10. Regularly supervise the development work
    carried by the Soccer Schools of Initiation with

the purpose of protecting the young talents
through the systematic application of the
proposals listed here.

11. Convince the teachers of the importance
    of using soccer activities as an educational
    instrument to improve the children‘s technical,
    tactical, visual, cognitive, and physical
    capacities.
- Healthful habits toward the practice of sport,


_Cultivating Talent in Young American Soccer_

_Techniques  Tactics 91_

thus maintaining and improving their health.

- Teaching them to efficiently occupy their leisure
    time with sport activities, offering enjoyment
    and pleasure.
- Contributing to the development of the
    personality of each one of the young players.
12. Consider as recommended schools only those
    Soccer Schools of Invitation of the State Soccer
    Federation which apply the philosophy and

the recommendations exposed here. If they
fulfill the norms imposed by a certification
committee, they will have the right to use the
badge of the Federation near the name of the
school. Through this procedure, the selected
schools attract the interest of the parents and
the public and will benefit from:

- Free insurance
- Discounts in the acquisition of sport
    material
- Free access to special coaching seminars or
    days organized by the federation for their
    teachers
- Help in connecting with other institutions
    (interchanges)
- Help in the organization of sport or cultural
    events, etc.
- Help with medical issues to detect any
    potential risk for the player’s health
13. Create a manual that orients the teachers
on how to periodically communicate with
the parents and how to collaborate in the
important task to support their ethical, moral,
physical, and intellectual growth, and leave
aside the material interests that the consumer
society wants to impose on the world of youth
soccer.
14. A teacher of young talents who always wins
with his or her team will lose at the end. So
what? He or she has done everything to assure
his or her own professional future and not the
one of his or her talented disciples. In youth
soccer, we say:

” To win one cup less means frequently to win more
than a promising talent”.

_The 1v1 Situation: The Foundation_

_Techniques  Tactics 93_

## The 1v1 Situation: The Foundation

Raffaele Tomarchio

Raffaele Tomarchio is the resident coach at http://www.
ICoachSoccer.ca. This article was published in the
January-February 2010 Soccer Journal.

I

t is no secret that one of the most important
situations during a soccer game is the 1v1 match-
up. During the course of a game, attackers have to
decide whether to beat an opponent by dribbling
past him or her or passing the ball, while defenders
try to prevent opponents from getting near the
goal and scoring. To be effective in the 1v1 situation,
each player must have a good overall technical and
tactical understanding. In many cases, the outcome
of a game is a direct result of the various 1v1
opportunities the team is able to win.

During the exercise of 1v1, each player can experience,
analyze and solve individual tactical situations while
attacking and defending. Furthermore, players come
to understand the level of their ability, both what
they do well and where they need work.

On the attacking side, players who have good
dribbling abilities combined with quickness and a
combination of moves and fakes will be successful
in beating an opponent. On the defending side,
good speed, determination and physical ability are
the key ingredients for good defense. What follows
is a series of 1v1 exercises that reflect the basic
1v1 situations. These are presented in a “guided
discovery” teaching style.

General guidelines

Attacking after the ball is won

What does a player do when receiving the ball in
these situations?

- Back to the opponent’s goal
    - Pass back
    - Turn to attack defender
- Facing the opponent’s goal
- Beat the defender
- Get into position to shoot
- In front of the goalkeeper
- Score with a direct shot on goal
- Dribble to the keeper to score a goal

Defending after the ball is lost

What does a player do after losing the ball?

- When chasing the opponent
    - Adjust running speed to the speed of attack
    - Time the tackle
- When trying to win the ball
    - Delay the attack
    - Channel the opponent wide
    - Time the tackle

1v1 with two goals and two keepers
with the attacker in possession
(Diagram # 1)

Attacker’s Objectives

- Beat the defender for shot on goal

Defender’s Objectives

- Slow down the attacker and channel outside

Organization

- Groups of six alternating attacking and
    defending. In a 15 by 20-yard grid, an attacker
    in possession of the ball takes on a defender
    and tries to score a goal. The attacker must
    cross the midline to score.


_94 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Attacker’s Solutions

- Look for the direct path to the goal
- If the defender gives space, shoot
- Try to unbalance the defender to get a shot

Defender’s Solutions

- Get in a line between the ball and the goal
- Assume a good defensive position – sideways on
- Adjust to the speed of the attacker
- Think: Can I win the ball?
- Think: If the attacker shoots, can I block it?

Coaching Points

- The coach asks the players: What went right?
    What went wrong? Why? What adjustments
    must be made?

1v1 with goals and two keepers
(Diagram #2)

Attacker’s Objectives

- After receiving the ball, the attacker attacks
    the goal frontally looking for a shot

Defender’s Objectives

- Prevent the shot on goal
- Channel the attacker to the outside

Organization

- Groups of 6 to 8 players alternating attacking
    and defending. In a 15 by 20-yard grid
    divided into thirds, the defender kicks the
    ball to the attacker, who, after receiving
    the ball, will attempt to score a goal. If the
    defender wins the ball, he attacks the goal.
    Variation: The defender can win the ball only
    in the mid third.

Attacker’s Solutions

- Good first touch and control the ball
- Go straight at the goal
- Use a change of pace and change of direction
    to beat the defender
- Before taking a shot on goal, look at the keeper

Defender’s Solutions

- Meet the attacker as far from the goal as
    possible
- Adjust your speed to the attackers speed
- Channel the attacker to the side by using
    proper body position – sideways on
- Look for a bad touch from the attacker

Coaching Points

- What went right? What went wrong? Why?
    What adjustments need to be made?

- After receiving the ball from his defensive
    goalkeeper with his/her back to goal; the
    attacker tries to turn the defender and shoot
    on goal

Defender’s Objectives

- Prevent the attacker from turning and channel
    the attacker to the side line

Organization

- A group of 6 to 8 players alternating between
    the attack and the defense. In a 15 by 20-yard
    grid, the goalkeeper throws the ball to the
    attacker, who will try to turn and shoot

Attacker’s Solutions

- Check back to the ball to create space and
    attack the ball
- If the defender is not close, turn and attack
    the goal
- If the defender is closing down the attacker,
    shield the ball and try to turn the defender for
    a shot on goal
- Before the shot, look at the keeper

Defender’s Solutions

- Do not be so tight that you can be turned – do
    not allow turn
- Can you win the ball?
- Channel the attacker wide

Coaching Points

- The coach asks the players: What went right?
    What went wrong? Why?
- What adjustments are needed?

1v1 on two small goals
(Diagram # 4)

Attacker’s Objectives

- Beat the defender and score goals

Defender’s Objectives

- Prevent shots on goal
- Channel attacker away from the goal

Organization

- Two groups in pairs alternating attacking and
    defending. In a 15 by 15-yard grid, the player
    with the ball has 30 seconds to beat the
    defender. If the defender wins the ball, he/she

(^3) has what is left of the 30 seconds to score.

_98 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Many other exercises can improve the 1v1
confrontation. The coach should make it
competitive, fun and informative. The 1v1 situation
should be part of the development plan at the
early ages.

Encourage experimentation and creativity with
young players. The defensive part of the exercise
is equally important and should be introduced
early. Enable the players to discover the different
problems they face by asking questions and
allowing the players to find solutions.

General points of methodology and organization

- From easy to more difficult tasks
- From known to unknown
- From simple to complex
- Lots of repetition and variations

General coaching points for attackers

- Go straight at the defender
- Be in control of the ball
- Unbalance the defender with feints
- Change direction
- Change speed
- Have a positive attitude

General coaching points for defenders

- Close the space between you and the attacker
- Slow down the attacker
- Get the attackers head down
- Channel the attacker wide
- Wait for the right moment to tackle

_Training the 2v1 Situation_

_Techniques  Tactics 99_

## Training the 2v1 Situation

Raffaele Tomarchio

_Making the 2v1 situation a regular staple of any
development program for the age groups of 8-12.
This is part one of a two-part series on the 2v1.
This was originally published on Icoachsoccer.ca
and in the March-April 2010 Soccer Journal._

Introduction

T

he 2v1 situation represents the basic starting
point in developing team play. Compared
to the 1v1, it is a more complex situation with
different elements for players to consider.

The 1v1 The 2v1

- Myself (The Player) • Myself (The Player)
- The Ball • The Ball
- The Opponent • The Opponent
    - The Teammate

From the tactical point of view, this situation helps
in the development of two important individual
tactical elements: passing and support.

Passing (Diagram # 1 and 2)

Passing is a technique used by two or more players
to transmit the ball from one player to another.
Although there are different ways to pass the ball,
there are two types of passing:

- Passing to Man
- Passing to Space

When passing to Man, the player receiving
the ball does not make any movement to space,
communicating that he/she wants the ball at
their feet.
When passing to Space, the player receiving
the ball makes a movement to the space,
communicating to the player in possession of the
ball his/her intention to receive the ball in his/
her running path so that he/she can gain proper
control of it. A good pass must be accurate, with
good pace and correct timing.

Support

Support is the ability of players to move and get
in the correct position to receive the ball. Knowing
how to pass the ball and putting yourself in a
good position to receive it goes hand in hand for a
successful attacking play. In 2v1 situations, players
are stimulated in solving the various problems
presented by the activity and to make the correct
decisions to solve them.

_100 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Player’s Decision Making in the 2v1 Situation
Player with the ball Player without the ball

- When to pass • When to get open and support
- Where to pass (feet or space) • Where to get open to support
- How to pass the ball (trajectory) • How to get open to support

2v1 Training

When designing and executing training exercises,
the coach must follow the proper coaching
methodology by:

- Identifying the exercise objective.
The exercise should be designed with a clear
    objective in mind (see list below).
- Setting up the exercise.
The coach, as a facilitator, should set up the
    area where the exercise is going to take place.
- Explain the exercise to the players (demo).
    Players need to understand what the
    requirements and rules of the exercise are.
    Explanations should be simple and concise,
    with a possible demonstration.
- Allow enough time to practice the exercise
    (repetitions).
Players must have enough time to practice a
    particular exercise (many repetitions).
- Using proper progressions.
From simple to complex, time pressure,
    handicaps.
- Observe and Correct.
Take time to observe the activities and provide
    the proper correction through “demos.“
- Evaluating the exercise.

    one team to pass the ball to the other team in
    the other grid.
- Each pass = one point.
- Change roles

Progression
Before passing the ball to the other grid, they must
complete at least 3 passes in their own grid.
Now, I would like to take a look at the coaching
points of the 2v1 situations. In order to help our
players, we must know the technical and tactical
elements of each situation, recognize mistakes
players make and create training sessions to correct
them. These are the standard 2v1 situations that
players encounter during a game:

2v1 for a shot on goal or to win
space (Diagram # 11)

The elements of the 2v1 are:

- The ball carrier
- The supporting player
- The defender

In these situations, the player in possession of the
ball is the one with the decision making power.
In pursuing the goal of this exercise, this player
has to decide whether to dribble the ball past the
defender, use the help of the supporting player in
order to get in a shooting position, or advance the
ball.

_104 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Decision making to dribble or pass

The ball carrier will decide whether to dribble or
pass the ball based on the position of
the defender.

To Dribble (Diagram #12)

If the defender takes a central position in respect to
the ball carrier and supporting player, then the ball
carrier will continue to dribble the ball toward the
available open space, and eventually (by changing
pace to advance the ball past the defender) to
deliver a shot on goal.

Coaching Points to Dribble

- Ball close to body
- Change of pace

To Pass to the Supporting Player
(Diagram #13)

If the defender comes out and challenges the ball
carrier by closing down the space in front, then the
logical option is to pass the ball to the supporting
player to advance the ball to the shooting zone for
a shot on goal.

Coaching Points to Pass to a Supporting Player
Ball Carrier

- Pace on the ball
- Pass to the receiving player’s path
- Time of the pass

Supporting Player

- Receives ball with the foot farthest away from
    the ball
- First touch to set up shot

Common errors players will make

Players are too close (Diagram #14)

Many times, especially in the younger age groups,
the players‘ starting position is too close to each
other, making the defender’s job to win the ball easier.

Coaching Points

- The starting position of both players needs to
    be as wide as the grid allows
- After the start, the players should maintain
    distance apart from each other

Supporting Player Position

Even though the supporting player has the correct
width in relation to the ball carrier, sometimes his
supporting angle might be wrong. In Diagram #
#15 with #11 in possession of the ball, #7 takes
a forward position in relation to #11. This creates
a problem for #11 because the defender #2 may
intercept.

In Diagram #16, #7, aligns his position with the
ball, giving #11 a better passing angle #7 can
now run to it and use the momentum to run past a
possible recovery attempt by #2.

Coaching Points

- Supporting player to stay wide with the line of
    the ball
- Supporting player to time his/her run

Supporting player receiving the ball
(Diagram #17)

When receiving the ball, the supporting player
must receive it with the foot farthest away from
the ball. Many times, especially when the ball
comes from the right side, players tend to use their
“comfortable” right foot instead of their left foot,

14

15

16


_106 The Best of Soccer Journal_

making the control of the ball difficult, as the ball
can roll over their foot, hence losing possession.
When using the opposite foot, the inside part of
the foot is used, which makes it easier to control
the ball.

## 2v2

Jim Lennox
NSCAA Director of Coaching Emeritus Hartwick College

J

im Lennox, director emeritus of the NSCAA
Coaching Academy, presented the following
session to the NSCAA coaching staff at its in-service
program held at Nova Southeastern University in
January of 1999.

The following are ways in which the coach can
make play more predictable in coaching 2v2
exercises. I will describe the objective of injecting
the variable into the coaching scheme and show,
by example, expected outcomes for the players
involved.

I. 2v2 on 20 x 35-40-yard field to small
goals

An obvious means for the two attackers is to try and
spread the two defenders so that the first attacker
can penetrate on a line or to a goal via the dribble
(Diagram # 1). Failing that, the goal here is for the
team with the ball to penetrate through the use of
combination play. A through pass (if defenders are

square, Diagram # 2) might be “on” as might a 1-2
or wall-pass — if the defender can be committed
by the first attacker and the second attacker can
support at the proper angle and distance. If the
first attacker is pressured and turned, that player
can initiate a takeover maneuver with the second
attacker or under the same circumstance, the

1

2

3


_108 The Best of Soccer Journal_

second attacker can make an overlapping run to
relieve pressure (Diagram # 3). The coaching
objective for the two defenders is to coordinate
their movement to pressure the ball and cover
the space.

The 20 x 35-40-yard space is ideal in that it allows
the coach to train the players on both sides of the
ball. The 40-yard length allows for penetration
while the 20-yard width encourages the defenders
to “squeeze” the attackers and win the ball for
themselves (Diagram # 4).

II. 2v2, in a longer space, on 20 x 40-45
yards to small goals

When the space is a longer rectangle, the coach is
emphasizing vertical play. The attackers attempt
to use the space behind the defenders with
long through passes or passes over the top. The
defenders must deal with tracking the attacker’s
vertical play. Fitness is also an objective here
(Diagram # 5).

4

5

6

7


_2v2_

_Techniques  Tactics 109_

III. 2v2 on 15 x 40-yard field to small goals

Here the objective is for the attacking team to
possess the ball, draw the defense to them and
then penetrate to goal. Patience with the ball is
critical here and if penetration is not “on,” then
the attacking team must play the ball back to a
supporting teammate (Diagram # 6) and seek to
establish space behind the defenders for the attack
to take place in. The defending team must seek to
high pressure the ball in this situation (Diagram # 7).

IV. 2v2 on 20 x 30-yard field to small
goals

Here, with the field shorter, the emphasis is on
tight technical play. A lot of lateral play with more
square passes for possession due to the limited
space behind the defenders. Lateral 1-2 movements
and takeovers will dominate the combination play.
The idea of the first attacker will be to find the
right moment to play flighted balls behind the
defense for the supporting attacker to run onto and
collect or shoot at goal. Defenders must cope with
lateral play, keep pressure on the ball and cover their
attempts to deny penetration (Diagram # 8).

V. 2v2 on 35 x 40-yard field to small
goals

Add two servers on the width of the field to play
with the team in possession of the ball seeking to
play the ball wide where the servers are limited to
two touches. They seek to serve balls into the area
for strikes on goal (headers, volleys). Defenders will
work on defensive heading (Diagram # 9).

8 9

10


_110 The Best of Soccer Journal_

VI. 2v2 on 20 x 35-yard field to small
goals

In the next exercise, position target players at
either side of the goal on each end of the fields for
the attacking team to use. Two attacking players
seek to play balls to target players (limited two
touches) at end of the field who then play balls
to either attacker for shots on goal. Defenders
attempt to track the runs, not ball watch and deny
penetration (Diagram # 10).

VII. 2v2 on 20 x 35-yard field to small
goals

In this exercise, instead of using target players,
position the support players on the sidelines.
Because the support players are on the sidelines,
the coach is emphasizing possession by the two
attackers. From possession, there will be opportunities
to achieve penetration (Diagram #11). Again, the
defenders must pressure and cover each other as
they deny penetration.

VIII. 2v2 on 20 x 35-yard field to small
goals

In this exercise of 2v2, we add target players for
each team into the field. Once the ball is won, the

designated target player plays in advance of the
ball. He or she does not try to score or defend. Both
teams of two will have their own target player. The
coach can limit target players to two touches.

The two attackers use their target as they did in
practice number V. This is basically a recreation of
midfield players playing to the feet of front players,
but playing on the field, not in an advanced
position near the goals (Diagram # 12). As with all
these exercises, defenders try to pressure and deny
penetration.

IX. 2v2 on 20 x 35-yard field to small
goals

The supporting player now plays behind the two
attacking players and is limited to two-touch play.
Each team has a support player. The objective is to
possess the ball 3v2. The support player becomes
the goalkeeper when the team is not in possession
of the ball. The object of the support player is to
seek through passes in combination play and also
to change the point of attack. Defensively, the
support player cannot run in advance of the ball or
try to win the ball (Diagram # 13). Defenders must
perform their function of denying penetration and
watch for opportunities to pressure the support
player.

11

12


_2v2_

_Techniques  Tactics 111_

X. 2v2 on 20 x 35-yard field to
regulation goals

In this variation, the free player must support the
team in possession of the ball from a back of ball
position. When one team gains possession, that
team must keep possession until the support players
run behind them to create a 3v2 (Diagram #14).
The objective is to penetrate for shots on goal
(Diagram #15).

I have used the group tactical exercise 2v2 to
demonstrate how a coach can manipulate the
variables of an exercise to elicit desired playing
behaviors. Any number of players may be used,
3v3, 8v8, 3v2, etc.

Typically, the coach will alter the size and number
of goals, use of target and support players both
outside and inside of the playing area, limit the
number of touches, and finally, define zones within
the playing area. The permutations and possibilities
are limited only by the imagination of the coach.

College since 1976 and has directed the Hawks
to numerous NCAA Division I Tournament
appearances and the national title in 1977.

## Combination Play for Attackers

Distinct movements and passes can achieve positive results

Tom Rowney
Oregon State University
March-April 1996

A

combination play may be defined as a
distinct grouping of movements and passes,
typically involving two or three teammates, that
create and/or exploit space. Probably the best
known and most widely practiced combination
play is the wall-pass (Diagram # 1). But there
are a number of others that can be used to take
advantage of a particular alignment of defenders
and attackers and can be accomplished through a
variety of angles, with lateral, vertical or diagonal runs.

Editor’s Note: In the Diagram #s that follow, unless
otherwise noted, each individual square represents
a 10-yard by 10-yard area. A broken line indicates
the movement of the ball; a solid line indicates the
movement of a player. The purpose of this article
is to illustrate the types of combination plays that
can be utilized and how those plays might be
practiced to achieve positive results in the game.

Type of combination plays

Based on the above definition, we can
categorize the following combination plays
into distinct groups:

- Penetrating wall-pass, set-up wall-pass,
    wall-pass fake and spin, pass and spin
- Takeovers
- Reverse-pass combinations
- Over-fake and over-fake spin
- Overlaps
- Third man runs

Practice session

Practice sessions for combination plays should
maintain a logically sequential teaching emphasis.
The initial emphasis should be on teaching the
technical and movement requirements in situations
that are pre-arranged by the coach. This can be
accomplished through basic grid work where correct
repetition of plays is of paramount importance.
Practice should then move on to small-sided or squad
games that stress the need for players to recognize
when the alignment or “shape” of defenders and
teammates predisposes the situation to execution of
a particular combination play. Finally, at the more
advanced levels, players should be expected to
actively create (by their movement and positioning)
situations that force opponents into an alignment
where a combination play will produce a successful
outcome. This can be accomplished in 11v11 game

(^1) sessions, as well as in squad games.


_Combination Play for Attackers_

_Techniques  Tactics 113_

The following, therefore, outlines a logically
sequential coaching session that includes:

- Theme-related warm-up
- Basic grid practice
- Small-sided game
- Squad game
- Regional practice/11v11 game.

The practices that follow will need to be divided
into a number of separate sessions – the number of
sessions will depend on the developmental level of
your team. Furthermore, while these practices may
be used for midfielder player functional practice
(since the combination plays are the same) we
have chosen to integrate finishing work into the
practices for two important reasons:

- Combination plays are used as a means to an
    end. The “end” (an attempt on goal), therefore,
    should be included in the practice.
- Including finishing work provides for a more
    economical use of practice time.

Warm-up

The theme-related warm-up includes the whole
squad in a 50x50-yard area. The squad is divided
into two equal-number groups with one group
arranged outside and evenly spread around grid
area and the other inside the grid as in Diagram # 2.

The warm-up begins with the inside player
conducting a combination play with any
outside player. After the combination play, the
participants change places. Combinations should
not be undertaken with the same teammate each
time. To simplify instructions for beginning or
intermediate players, places need not be changed
after completion of the combination. Places can be
switched after a one to two-minute period.

The coach should encourage verbal communication
from insider players, particularly at the beginning
levels where players should only need to say the
name of a teammate (i.e., “Yes, Jane!”). In more

complicated moves, where the combination is on the
blind side of the supporting player the combination
player should be indicated to the teammate what
needs to be accomplished, (e.g., “Over, Jimmy”) to let
the teammate know to leave the ball.

The following combinations are conducted for a
period of one to two minutes with a period of
stretching between changes. Players inside the grid
start with a ball each and compete the following:

- Wall-pass combination Move toward a player
    on the outside of the grid and complete a wall-
    pass. After receiving the return pass, the ball
    is played back to the wall player, who moves
    into the grid area changing places with the
    teammate. The new inside player now finds a
    different outside player with whom to conduct
    a wall-pass combination (Diagram # 2).
- Pass and spin combination Move toward a
    player on the outside of the grid. As the ball
    is played to the outside player, spin to receive
    the return pass into place. After spinning and
    receiving the ball, play the ball back to the
    outside player and change places (Diagram # 3).
- Over-fake combination The same as above,
    but the ball is returned softly back to the feet
    of the inside player who allows the ball to

2


_114 The Best of Soccer Journal_

run across the body or through the legs while
turning. The receiving player should dip the
shoulder toward the wall before turning. After
the turn, play the ball back to the outside
player and change places.

- Takeover combination In Diagram # 4, an inside
    player communicates and completes a takeover
    with an outside player. The player previously in
    possession moves to the place outside the grid
    vacated by the teammate. Progress to practicing
    the faked takeover where the player in possession
    “dribbles” post the teammate rather than
    allowing the teammate to take over possession
       - Reverse-pass combination The inside player
          communicates with an outside player and
          completes a reverse pass combination using the
          roll-back, heel, flick-pass, or instep technique.
          The player previously in possession moves to
          the place outside the grid vacated by the
          teammate (Diagram # 5).
       - Two-Person overlap combination In Diagram
          # 6, the inside player plays a pass to an outside
          player (who moves slightly into the grid area
          to receive the pass). The passer then overlaps
          around the teammate and receives the return
          pass. The overlapping player returns the ball to

3

4

5

6


_Combination Play for Attackers_

_Techniques  Tactics 115_

the teammates and moves to the place outside
the grid vacated by the teammate.

Warm-up progression

The warm-up progresses by dividing players into
groups of three and increasing the grid area, if
required, to accommodate squad size. One member
of the group positions outside the grid area with a
ball while the other two work as a pair inside the
grid area (Diagram # 7)

- Over-fake combination An inside player
    communicates with an outside player to receive
    a pass. The inside player allows the pass to run
    across the body or through the legs to inside
    partner behind. After allowing the ball to run
    through, the player should spin to receive a
    possible pass from partner in possession. The
    player now in possession keeps the ball and
    changes places with the outside player. The
    outside player moves inside to make a new pairing
    with the remaining inside player, as in Diagram # 7.
- Three-person overlap combination In
    Diagram # 8, an inside player communicates
    with an outside player to receive a pass. The
    other inside partner overlaps the outside player
    who moves into grid area. The inside player

receiving the initial pass plays a second pass
to the overlapping teammate. The overlapping
teammate (now with the ball) changes places
with the outside player.

Basic grid practice for two-person
combinations

After completing a warm-up with a variety of
combination plays, the practice can progress to
basic grid work in which the coach prearranges the
situation so that players, through repetition, can
focus on the technical and movement requirements
of the play.

In Diagram # 9, two groups of 2 (attackers) v.
1 (defender) with a goalkeeper are arranged in
a 30x20-yard grid. Each group of three should
alternate after completing a combination play.

Initially, the coach should condition defenders to a
passive role where the defender does not attempt
to stop the combination play. An alternative to
passive defending is to require the defender to
defend one aspect of the play only. For example,
in the penetrating wall-pass play, the defender
may be conditioned to defend the dribble only.
Progression to a more realistic defensive role can

(^7) be made as combination plays are learned. At
8


_116 The Best of Soccer Journal_

this point, the attacking players must determine
whether to continue the combination or to fake
the combination and select another option. Players
should practice faking combinations if the defense
reads the situation correctly. For example, the
penetrating player in a wall-pass should dribble
if the immediate opponent attempts to cut out
the initial pass. In any case, players should be
regularly reminded that combinations function to
create and/or exploit space – it is not necessary to
complete a combination if the initial movements of
teammates and opponents have created a better
alternative.

The above practice organization can be used for
all of the following two-person combinations –
the wall-pass, wall-pass fake and spin, takeover,
reverse-pass, and the two-person overlap.

Wall-pass combinations

The wall-pass involves two teammates – the
penetrating player (initially in possession of the
ball) and the wall player – and can be divided
into four distinct variations:

- The penetrating wall-pass
- The set-up wall-pass
- The wall-pass fake and spin
- The pass and spin.

Penetrating wall-pass

The penetrating wall-pass is used to get around
an immediate opponent and exploit the open
space behind that opponent (Diagram # 9 above).
In any 2v1 situation, a good defender will “drop
off” in an attempt to delay the attack and keep
both attacking players in sight. In this case, it is
vitally important that the penetrating player draws
the immediate defender “in” toward the ball, i.e.,
commit the opponent by attacking the opponent
at speed. In the initial stages of practice, however,
the defender can be conditioned to commit the
penetrating player at speed.

The pass to the wall player is made at a point
as close to the defender as possible but not so
close that the defender has the opportunity to
intercept the pass. Making the initial pass in mid-
stride (particularly with the outside of the foot) is
preferable, as this will allow the player to maintain
and build on existing momentum. As the pass is
made, the penetrating player should accelerate
past the defender into the space behind and
prepare to receive the return ball. If the defender
moves to cut out the initial pass, the penetrating
player should dribble past the opponent.

Coaches should encourage the use of a variety
of techniques (push-pass, instep, or outside of
foot) for playing the initial and return ball while
advocating the use of the best technique given the
situation. The choice of technique for the initial
pass will depend on the penetrating player’s stride
pattern and the location of the ball at the point
of contact.

The choice of technique for the wall player will
depend primarily on the body position as contact is
made, the location of the ball as it arrives, and the
required timing of the return pass. Competency in a
variety of techniques will allow for a variety in the
timing of the return pass.

_Techniques  Tactics 117_

Set-up wall-pass

In the set-up wall-pass, the wall player is typically
used to lay off to or set up a teammate for a dribble,
pass, or shot (Diagram # 10). It is a combination
that works well in preventing opposing defenders
from covering dangerous space or combining to
rectify a numbers-down situation. In Diagram # 10,
the covering defender shifts toward the receiving
player to prevent the player from turning with the
ball. This creates space, and in our practice set-up,
a shooting lane for the penetrating player. When
playing the ball off, the wall player often needs only
to control the ball rather than pass it in order to “set
it up” for a teammate. Furthermore, more advanced
players can and should practice this play with the
wall player moving in one direction while “laying off” the
ball in another direction with the use of a reverse pass.

Wall-pass fake and spin

Wall-passes in tighter situations are often more
effective than those conducted over a greater
area. This is because when the distances between
combining teammates is greater, defenses have
more time to read and adjust defensive shape to
the counter the play. In such situations, the wall
player may find it more beneficial to fake the wall-
pass and spin with the ball.

The wall-pass fake and spin (Diagram # 11) is
a particularly useful faked combination. If the
isolated defender reads the return pass and
attempts to intercept it and/or shift across to close
down the penetrating player, the receiving player
should fake to play the return pass but allow the
ball to run across the body or through the legs and
turn with the ball to attack the scoring area.

At the more advanced levels, the penetrating play
may “draw” the defender by loudly demanding
the return pass. Alternatively, the wall player can
communicate an intention to make a return pass
before spinning with the ball. Either way, the wall
player must anticipate the movement of defenders
and react accordingly.

As the teammate spins in possession, it is vitally
important that the penetrating player continue his
or her run into the scoring region. This will provide
support for his or her teammate and will leave
the player well placed to finish off any rebounds.
Players who learn to keep their runs going in this
way score more than their fair share of easy goals.

Pass and spin

The pass and spin is another variation on the basic
wall-pass. In Diagram # 12, the ball is played into
a tightly marked player who has checked to receive
the initial pass. The receiving player returns a first
time ball to his or her teammate then spins into
space behind the defender to receive the final
pass. The pass and spin is most effective when the
spinning player is tightly marked and the initial
return pass is played the first time.

Takeovers

The takeover combination involves two players –
one in possession of the ball – and can occur when
teammates attack the same space. In Diagram #13,
the player in possession is making a lateral run
across the preparation area (the area 20 to 30
yards from the goal) while the supporting player
makes a run along a line parallel to and behind
the teammate in possession. As the players come
together, the possession player “leaves” the ball for
his or her teammate to take and penetrate into the
space behind the defender. In almost all takeover
circumstances, the player in possession must be
moving the ball with the “off-defender” foot, i.e.
the foot farthest from the immediate defender.
A common mistake in this combination is for the

possession player to “pass” the ball to the receiver
at the last second, rather than letting the receiver
“take” the ball.

Coaches should stress that, in a takeover
combination, the function of the possession player
is to protect the ball from opponents until the
takeover is complete. Both the possession and
receiving players should accelerate out of the take-
over phase and continue to penetrate at pace.

A variation of the takeover can be accomplished
when the possession player allows the ball to run
into the path of a teammate resulting in a first-time

12

14


_Combination Play for Attackers_

_Techniques  Tactics 119_

shot or pass (Diagram #14). In this move, the player
releasing possession must step aside from the space
that his or her teammate is attacking.

A final option for attacking teammates is to
fake the takeover. This occurs when the player in
possession keeps possession by dribbling past his
or her teammate. Faked takeovers are particularly
effective at the advanced levels of the game
where opponents are more attuned to reading and
adjusting to combination plays.

Regardless of the variety of takeover possibilities,
coaches should emphasize that, whenever a player
with the ball runs toward or across the line of
another teammate, or a player without the ball
runs similarly toward a teammate in possession,
both must anticipate the opportunity to complete
a takeover.

Reverse-pass combinations

Takeover and reverse-pass combinations are similar
in terms of the types of combined runs that paired
teammates can undertake. The difference is that
in reverse-pass combinations the receiving player
typically attacks space vacated by the teammate
in possession, and the ball is actually passed into
the vacated space (rather than “taken over” by the
receiving player.

Reverse-passes can be accomplished with the
outside of the foot or a flick pass, the instep, a
roll-back with the ball of the foot or the heel. In
Diagram # 15, the supporting player attacks the
space vacated by a teammate in possession. The
ball is played back into the place – using one of
the above techniques – for the supporting player
to run on to.

An option for the player in possession is to fake the
reverse-pass in an attempt to gain extra yardage
on the immediate opponent and continue in
possession of the ball. A faked roll-back with the

ball of the foot is a particularly effective deception.
Another alternative is a fake to play the ball back
with the instep of one foot while playing the ball
with the other, used with great success by Peter
Beardsley of Newcastle United and England.

The two-person overlap

The overlap can include two, three, or more players.
Diagram # 16 depicts a typical overlapping
combination between two players facing one
defender. The penetrating player passes to, and
then makes a run around, a teammate to receive
a pass in the space behind or the other side of
the defender. If the defender closed down the
receiving player, the pass can be made to the
overlapping player. If the defender moves to prevent
the pass to the overlapping player, the receiving
player can maintain possession by dribbling
inside the defender. Again, communicating an
intention to complete an overlap will enhance
the deception if the receiving player decides to
dribble past the defender.

Three-person combination play

In Diagram # 17, two groups of 3v1 with a
goalkeeper are arranged in a 30 x 20 yard grid.
The coach should condition the defenders to be

15


_120 The Best of Soccer Journal_

passive. This practice organization can be used for
all the three-person combinations in this section –
the over-fake, the over-fake and spin, three-person
overlap and the third-man running activities.

Over-fake or “dummy”

The over-fake combination is also known as the
“dummy” and involves three players – the passer,
the fake player and the receiving player. Diagram
17 depicts a typical over-fake move in which the

fake player feigns receiving the ball and lets it run
to the receiving player behind. The faking player
should finish the fake by spinning away toward the

goal. The spin should be undertaken as quickly as
possible but not so early that the defender reads
the fake.

The receiving player must carefully consider the
timing of the run into the space behind the faking
player. If the run is too late, the player will not
reach the pass. If the run is too early, the player
might over run the pass or may lose momentum
which may be needed to beat the defender.

Over-fake and spin

The over-fake and spin involves three players and
is a logical extension of the previous move in
which the faking player spins to penetrate into
the scoring area to receive a return pass. As in
the previous combination, the fake player feigns
receiving the ball but lets it run across the body or
through the legs to a receiving teammate behind.

Advanced players can develop this combination
and the previous one by chipping the original pass
directly to the receiving player with the receiving
player volleying, chesting or heading the ball down
for the spinning teammate in Diagram # 18.

_Techniques  Tactics 121_

The three-person overlap

More intricate overlapping moves can be constructed
to include three players for advanced groups
(Diagram # 19). Such overlaps are beneficial in
developing the timing of runs and passes.

Third-man runs

A third-man run is a general or catch-all term
used to describe any three-person combination
play including, but not limited to the overlap
and over-fake outlined previously. Specifically, it
incorporates those situations in which a second or
third pass in a sequence finds a third teammate
with the ability to exploit space.

For any three-man run combinations to be
successful, three things must happen:

- Opponents must initially be focused in the
    vicinity of the ball
- Both the possession player and the penetrating
    player must be aware of exploitable space
- Runs and passes must be timed with precision.

Diagram # 20 depicts a typical third-man running
combination in which two teammates complete

a crossover play while a third plays a penetrating
pass to one of the original teammates who
has continued to attack the space behind the
defenders.

Small-sided games

Once players have a solid understanding of the
timing and technical requirements of a variety
of combination moves, practice can progress
to small-sided games. Small-sided games (and
the following squad games) should be used to
encourage players to recognize when the alignment
or shape of defenders and teammates pre-disposes
the situation to execution of a particular play.

Diagram # 21 depicts a 4v4 game with goalkeepers
with two attackers against one defender who are
restricted to an assigned half in a 60 x 30 yard
field. Attacking players are required to complete
a combination play or faked combination play
before a shot can be taken. At the initial levels of
practice, the defenders may be conditioned to stay
goal side until an attacking player takes the first
touch. The offside law may also be off. When the
defender wins the ball, he plays it to a teammate
on the other side of the grid. Goalkeepers may play
to defenders or attackers.

19

20


_122 The Best of Soccer Journal_

The practice is progressed by adding players to
produce a 6v6 with 3v2 in each half of the field. In
this practice, a defender in possession is initially
allowed to pass and move into or run with the
ball into the other half of the field creating a
4v2 situation. Practice is further progressed by
restricting all players to their assigned half of the
field.

As players develop, they should be encouraged
to “set up” a particular combination with their
movement and positioning and be required to
maintain a high level of concentration; a momentary
lapse could mean the loss of a scoring opportunity.

Squad game

Once the players are comfortable with combining
in grids and small-sided games, progress can be
made to more dynamic and game-like squad games.
For our theme, the squad is divided into teams (from
4v4 and up) in a regular game with no restrictions.
The number of players in the squad determines
field size. Players can be conditioned to complete
a number of combination plays before shooting.
It is also recommended that the coach introduce
a point system in which, for example, two points
are awarded for a combination play or faked

combination in any region in the field, four points
for combination play that leads to a shot on
goal, six points for a combination play that leads to
a goal, and 10 points for having two combination
plays in a row, i.e., a wall-pass with an over-fake
combination!

The focus of this practice (and the following
regional and 11v11 game practice) is for players to
recognize the opportunity to select and accomplish
the right combination or faked combination play
given the situation and to correctly execute the
chosen play with respect to the timing of runs and
passes. Players should be encourage to “set up”
a particular combination with movement, passing
and positioning – in other words, be proactive
rather than reactive.

Regional and 11v11 game practice

Practices using the regional or 11v11 format are
probably the most important. This is because the
angles and distances are most game-like. Practice
at the regional level takes place in one half of the
field but should be focused in what might be called
the preparation area of the field that is 20 to 40
yards from the goal.

21

22


_Combination Play for Attackers_

_Techniques  Tactics 123_

Diagram # 22 shows a regional practice where four
attackers play against three defenders and a goal
keeper. To start this in a realistic way, the ball is
initially played to a defender who clears the ball
to an attacking player. The attacking players then
must complete a single or series of combination
plays before a shot can be taken.

The coach should emphasize the need for
movement and tight passing, as teammates get
closer to the opponent‘s goal. If the defending
team wins possession, they must combine to get
a teammate across the mid line with possession of
the ball. The practice continues by adding players
to each team until the teams are at full strength.

Since this provides for the most realistic game
situations and allows the coach to integrate
the teaching and learning that has taken place
previously, the final progression in any theme
practice should be 11v11.

at this level, the overall focus should be to:

- Gain an understanding of where on the
    field combination play might be attempted.
    Attempting combination play in one’s own
    penalty box carries considerable risk, while
    to do so in the opponent’s box has more
    benefit.
- Encourage players to attempt combination
    play when the opportunity arises.
- Encourage players to create opportunities
    for combination play by their movement
    and positioning.
- Encourage players to make correct
    decisions with regards to options or
    faking combination play. Remind players
    that faking a combination play is just as
    effective as a real combination play.
- Emphasize that combination play is a
    means to an end – scoring goals.

## Recognizing the Moment

Coaches can help players improve anticipation,
become faster in decision-making

Wayne Harrison

A

s coaches, we must teach players to
establish in their minds what to do with
the ball before they receive it, not after. Encourage
players to look before they receive the ball to be
aware of their options in advance. For example,
if a player only has enough time to pass the ball
with one touch, he needs to know where his pass
is going before the ball arrives. By improving
anticipation, coaches help players become faster
with their overall decision-making.

Anticipation begins with awareness. At every
instant, your players must observe where the ball
is coming from and how it is traveling (in the
air, on the ground, quickly, slowly, etc.). They
must also have the ability to look beyond the
ball, maintaining an awareness of the relative
positioning of teammates and opposing players,
and the direction in which each player is moving.
The following coaching points will help you improve
your players’ awareness of their surroundings:

- Keep your head up. Avoid looking down at the
    ball, and consequently not observing what is
    around and where players are in relation to each
    other.
- Look before receiving. Anticipate the next
    pass before you receive the ball by looking
    over both shoulders and thinking ahead. With
    younger players, equate this concept to a bird
    on a fence looking around.
- Maintain an “open” body stance. Do this
    by turning “side on” (half turned) for greater
    peripheral vision and by taking an angle of
    support that allows you to see most (if not all)
    of the other players on the field.
       - Focus on the first touch. Relax as you receive
          the ball so you can control it quickly, and move
          the ball away from pressure on your first touch
          to create more space and time.
       - Communicate to help the receiver. Use brief
          phrases like “man on,” “turn” and “time” so that
          players on the ball know whether or not they
          are about to be pressured by the opponent.
          Practice this type of verbal communication
          during non-competitive activities to simulate
          game situations.

Anticipation also requires imagination. To anticipate
their future options, players must first be able to
imagine how their teammates and opponents are
likely to react following each touch of the ball. They
must also have insight into the use of the ball and
how various techniques can be employed to both
control the ball and play it into different spaces.
The next set of coaching points will help cultivate
imagination and creativity among your players.

- Change pace. When you receive the ball, accelerate
    with it to get away from near-by defenders.
- Change direction. Turn with the ball on your
    first touch to move off at new angles. A change
    of direction can be especially effective when
    combined with a change of pace.
- Look for opportunities to take a “big first
    touch.” Before the ball arrives, look for spaces
    away from both your current position and
    nearby opponents. Play the ball into these
    open spaces on the first touch to “get behind”
    the defense quickly.
- Move off the ball to provide support. Once
    you have made a pass, look to support others


_Recognizing the Moment_

_Techniques  Tactics 125_

in possession so you can receive the ball again.
Avoid standing still or “admiring your pass”
since this effectively takes you out of the game.
Move aggressively to support the next pass as
the ball is traveling to a teammate.

- Switch the play. Let the ball run across your
    body to change direction and switch play,
    saving a touch by using your upper body to
    Feinting your movement and the pace of the
    pass to help you. Recognize the available space
    behind you before you receive the pass.
- Take advantage of crossover runs. Instead of
    relying solely on the pass, create deception through
    take-overs and “fake-overs.” Use your inside foot to
    exchange (or keep) the ball, and accelerate
    away from the crossover point as a decoy run.
- Alternate between one- and two-touch
    play. Change the attacking rhythm frequently
    so that players must always think two (or
    more) moves ahead of the current situation.
    Supporting players must quickly find angles
    off each receiving player so the ball can be
    delivered with just one touch.
- Play without communication. Challenge your
    players to think for themselves with no help
    from others – no verbal or non-verbal help such
    as calls of “man on,” “turn,” clapping or pointing.

The training program is designed to develop
players’ composure when in possession of the ball, to
increase time on the ball by anticipating situations
ahead of time, to decrease the time needed to
move the ball, by having total awareness of all
players around them, and by encouraging players
to use their imagination in their use of the ball and
by allowing them to make their own decisions.

The point is not to have players playing at 100
miles an hour and playing one touch all the time
but to teach them to be aware of the options
before they receive the ball. Then, they can decide,
does the ball need to go one touch; do I need to
hold onto the ball for longer until another option
opens up; is this the time to run with the ball or
dribble with it?

The coaching ideals are designed to help the
players give themselves as many options as possible
and then decide which one to use at any given
moment. They are not designed to discourage
dribbling with the ball nor running with the ball
while keeping possession yourself (because many
of the sessions encourage the quick movement of
the ball between players, especially one- and two-
touch play), but to help identify when dribbling or
running with the ball, for example, would be the
right option to use. One of the biggest problems
in youth soccer is that when there is a moment to
play one- or two-touch, the moment is lost because
the player isn’t yet aware of this option – he or she
is too busy controlling the ball and then looking
to see where the players are. By then, it is too late.
They may dribble or run with the ball to get out of
trouble, but the best option of the quick one- or
two-touch pass was lost. Your players must rely on
their anticipation, imagination, and awareness to
aid their decision-making process. At any point in
time, each player must decide the following:

The decision-making thought process — what
happens to each player as the ball arrives?

- Observing where the ball is coming from
- Observing how the ball is coming
- Knowing where their teammates are
- Knowing where the opposition players are
- Deciding what the player should do with the
    ball and the appropriate technique or skill to use
- Observing where to play the ball
- Deciding when to play the ball
- Deciding how to play the ball
- Deciding why a given choice is best

If a player is being closed down as he/she receives
the ball, the player may have to determine the
answers to these questions before the ball arrives.
Otherwise, with time on the ball, he/she can
wait for the right moment depending on the
positions of teammates and the opposition. This is
when reaction plays a part in the process. As the
other players move about the field of play, they
constantly create new situations for the player on


_126 The Best of Soccer Journal_

the ball to assess and respond to with the correct
pass, dribble, run, shot, cross and so on.

To put these concepts into practice, it is best
that you follow a training progression that begins
with “shadow play.” These types of activities lack
pressure from an opponent, and thus allow a
developmental program to take place without a
loss of possession caused by defensive pressure.
Although there are no defenders, shadow play
should include other players who effectively
simulate pressuring situations by working in the
same area. This stage of the progression will give
your players a chance to develop composure on the
ball, which is a critical element for future success.

Next, introduce opposition, initially using an
overload situation (such as 5v2 or 6v3). During
this stage, reinforce the idea of “playing ahead of
the game” by looking beyond the ball to anticipate
future options. Encourage players to remain
composed with the ball and relax under pressure,
while also using correct technique to perform each
task efficiently and effectively. The players must
pay particular attention to the first touch of the
ball.

Finally, you should include full-scale practices to
put players in the pressure situations they face
on the field in regular team play. The coach must
try to build into the player each observation as it
happens. Over time and with much practice, the
player learns to assimilate each observation more
quickly until eventually they all combine into one
in the mind.

Players must be both psychologically and physically
prepared to meet the demands of the game. Their
development in these respects will be ongoing
throughout their playing career and will be further
influenced by the experience gained from every
coaching session and game played. The degree of
improvement a player attains using these methods
depends on his commitment (in terms of repetition
of practice and belief in the system) and level of ability.

Do not expect results overnight. Players have to be
patient in learning this approach as it takes time
and great concentration to develop. But, in the end,
they should benefit from improved decision-making
that allows them to work ahead of the opposition.

Identifying Levels of Awareness

1. Start with only one team to simplify the process
    for the players as an easy introduction to the
    idea. Then divide them into two teams once
    they are starting to master the idea. Have the
    players stand still and pass the ball around the
    group. They must look before they receive the
    ball to see where they are passing. Make it two-
    then one-touch.
2. To ensure they are looking, have the players
    call the name of the player they are passing to
    before they pass the ball. When they don’t call
    the name, you know they haven’t looked ahead
    of the ball. Observe which players can’t do this
    and allow them two touches and more time
    and look to see how they improve with practice.
3. Develop: Have two teams and have them pass
    to opposite colors so there are fewer choices,
    so the players have to be even more aware
    of where they are passing before they receive

1


_Recognizing the Moment_

_Techniques  Tactics 127_

the ball. Introduce two balls to the session,
then three and so on. Have players continue to
stand still and not move to keep it simple. Have
them begin to move around the area slowly
to make the decision-making more difficult as
players are harder to find.

Two Teams Playing Through Each Other

1. This is the basic beginning of the A.I.A. session
    where we have all the players moving freely
    passing and moving within their own team.
    Divide the group into two teams again. Begin
    with one ball being passed around a team and,
    as they become proficient, introduce another
    ball to increase their A.I.A qualities.
2. Have the teams play throughout both grids
    to spread the play out and get the players
    comfortable and composed. As they improve,
    you can change it to playing in one grid only so
    there is less room to work in and things happen
    more quickly. This is a test of their A.I.A. ability.

Technical/Tactical Design
The following information and coaching points
form the basis of what the session is designed to
achieve.

- The players must play with their heads up (so
    they view what is around)
- Look over the shoulder before receiving the ball
- Body stance is open to receive the ball.
- Awareness of teammates‘ positions on the field
    before receiving the pass
- Awareness of opponents‘ positions on the field
    before receiving the pass.
- Move the ball on the first touch away from
    pressure into space (or one-touch transfer).
    Receiver moves the ball away at an angle off
    the first touch
- Passing to space to move players into a better
    position on the field
- Passing to the player’s feet
- Turns/dribbles, one-touch, two-touch, free play, etc.
- Communication (verbal, physical or through
    eye contact)
- Angles/distances of support
- To increase competitive edge, passer pressures
    receiver by closing them down after the pass

As you practice with your team, do not try to
develop all the previous key coaching points in one
session. It may be that you have to spend several
sessions on just establishing the first key point
of getting the players to play with their head up
and not looking down at the ball when they have
it. Once you believe you are getting success with
this, only then should you move to working on the
second point in your next practices. This process of
learning is the same as in the introduction where
there are several things the player must think
about even before they receive the ball, beginning
with seeing where the ball is coming from and so
on, up to the selection of the pass.

Two Teams Playing Through Each
Other then Becoming Competitive

1. Once the players “get it,” it is time to introduce
    a competitive element to the game. Have one
    ball to play with and make it a possession
    game. Introduce another ball so each team has

2


_128 The Best of Soccer Journal_

two balls to focus on at the same time so one
team’s players can be defenders trying to win
a ball back and at the same time be attackers
having possession of the other ball.

2. It may be that a particular player is involved In
    trying to win a ball back but has to be aware
    that other teammates have possession of the
    second ball and he/she may have to adjust
    thinking and positioning instantly if a player
    looks to pass the second ball to him/her. This
    helps the mind prepare for instant transitions
    from attack to defense and defense to attack.
    They need to be aware of changing their focus;
    one second trying to win a ball but the next
    making themselves available to receive another
    ball from a teammate already in possession.
3. On changing from a defender to an attacker
    by receiving the second ball that this player’s
    team has possession of, this player must think
    about where the other players are who are
    free to pass to in order to keep the momentum
    of the game going. Going back to the A.I.A.
    principles, this player has to know where the
    ball is going before receiving it to have the best
    chance of keeping possession of this second ball.
4. The next stage may be that the team wins
    back the first ball so they have two balls to

keep possession of. This means the players are
constantly looking around the area they are
playing in, focusing on keeping two balls. As
soon as a player receives and passes on one
ball, they are looking to receive and pass the
second ball and so on.

5. Above, each team has a ball to keep possession
    of and at the same time try to win possession
    of the ball they haven’t got.
6. Observe: (C) and (D) make movements to
    support (E) to keep the ball, at the same time
    (B) and (F) close down (double team) (3) on
    the other team in possession of the other ball.
7. Observe: (1) and (2) close down (E) to win back
    the ball and (5) and (6) move into space to
    support and receive a pass from (3).
8. Continue by adding a third ball. Awareness
    must be really sharp now with so much to think
    about; which balls we have in our possession
    and consequently where we have to position
    ourselves to keep possession, but also, which
    balls we do not have and how we need to work
    to try and win them back.
9. Decision-making now is being tested to the
    fullest capacity. Do I support the balls we have,
    do I defend to win back the balls we do not,
    do I change mid-stream as the opportunity
    presents itself? Every player needs to be aware
    of all these options. When we go back to one
    ball with two teams playing simple possession,
    the A.I.A. instincts of the players should be
    more developed and sharp.

Numbers Game: Passing in Sequence

1. Players and only one ball to begin. Players
    must pass in sequence, i.e., (1) passes to (2);
    (2) passes to (3); (3) to (4) and so on to (8)
    who passes to (1) and we begin again. You

3


_Recognizing the Moment_

_Techniques  Tactics 129_

can have players static to begin, then have them
passing and moving.

2. Player receives from the same person and passes
    to the same person each time. This develops great
    awareness of time, space and player positions.
    Continuous work on and off the ball.
3. Awareness of where the player you receive from
    is and where the player you pass to is. Because
    of this, players begin to anticipate the pass to
    them and where it is coming from. Also they
    must look to where it is going to (where is the
    player they are passing to?).
4. We are trying to create a situation where
    players are looking two moves ahead, not just
    one. For instance as (1) is about to pass to (2),
    (3) should be looking to support (2) for the
    next pass already, looking two moves ahead
    before the ball leaves (1). At the same time, (3)
    should be looking to see where (4) is.
5. Peripheral vision development results from this.
    You may ask players to make it difficult to find
    them by lots of movement off the ball to test
    their teammate’s vision.
6. Variation: Use two balls, then three balls at
    the same time. Start with a ball at (1) and (5)

then at (1), (4) and (7). To keep the sequence
going, players must move the balls quickly
with few touches, hence their peripheral vision
development improves dramatically. As soon as
they have passed one ball off, the next one is
arriving so quickly that thinking is needed to
make the correct decisions.

Transition Game: Defense to Attack
and Attack to Defense

1. There are two teams and one ball with players
    passing to anyone. Passer (1) plays the ball to
    the receiver (2). The passer (1) then becomes a
    defender and must pressure receiver (2).
2. Receiver (2) must work a 1 - 2 around the defender
    (1) with a support player. Try to establish support
    on both sides of the receiver so there are two
    options available to support (3 and 4).
3. Work on angles and distances of support (triangular
    support), timing of the pass depending on the
    closeness of the defender, quality of the pass
    (preferably off the front foot to aid the Feinting
    of the pass). Receiver accepts 1-2 from support
    player (4), passes to a new receiver (5) and becomes
    the new defender and the cycle begins again.

4. Routine: a) (1) passes to (2) and pressures; b). (3)
    and (4) move to support (1) (thinking two moves
    ahead); c) (2) passes to (4); d) (2) runs around (1)
    to receive (give and go); e) Now (2) passes to (5)
    and becomes the defender.
5. Variation: Increase number of balls, passing
    to opposite color only but support from same
    color, i.e., pass opposite, support same. Quick
    decisions required. Passer plays the ball to
    receiver and closes down as a defender;
    receiver must move the ball away first time or
    draw defender in and move the ball off at an
    angle away from the pressure.

Specific Peripheral Vision
Coaching Sessions

This is a simplified set up to get initial
understanding. Increase numbers as previously
shown in two teams of six. We started earlier with
one ball and six players for example so each person
on the ball had five choices to make and that was
easy. Now we must identify one and only one pass
and try to make it. That pass is to the person who
runs outside the zone. This player is the free player
(unmarked). The session goes as follows:

1. Player (1) runs outside the area (perhaps after
    several passes within the zone). Player (2) on
    the ball sees the run and must pass to (1). As
    (1) is about to receive (as the ball is traveling to
    him or her), (3) moves into a position to support
    (1), showing anticipation and awareness. As (3)
    receives the pass, (4) makes a run out of the area.
2. (3) has already seen the run by (4) and passes. (4)
    brings the ball back in and the game continues.
    This is an indicator of how quickly players recognize
    the run and consequently make the pass.
3. Hence players are beginning to look one and
    two moves ahead of the ball. It doesn’t need to
    happen so quickly in terms of the next player
    running outside, but it serves as an example.
    The run can be likened to a penetrating run
    into the attacking third where the player hasn’t
    been picked up or tracked and is in a great
    position to attack and score if the passer sees
    them and makes that pass.
4. Within the zone there are many choices of
    pass but as soon as a player makes the run
    outside that is the pass to make. The coach can
    determine the tempo of the game, e.g., to avoid
    too many running out at the same time, the
    coach can signal to an individual player to move
    out without the others knowing so only one at a
    time goes out.
5. Once the free player is outside and waiting for
    a pass, see how many passes are made inside
    the zone before someone sees the right pass,
    i.e., to the outside player. This is an indication
    of which players play with their heads up (good
    peripheral vision) and which do not (poor
    peripheral vision or even none at all).
6. The fewer touches on the ball the player
    needs to get the ball there, the greater their
    anticipation of the run. One touch is the
    ultimate aim, to reach the point where the

(^6) ball is traveling to the player at the same time


_Recognizing the Moment_

_Techniques  Tactics 131_

another player makes their run out; they see
the run and make the pass at the same time.

7. More touches means more reaction time needed
    and in a game situation this may mean the
    player being caught in possession before they
    get around to making the pass. Initially the coach
    may see several passes made within the area
    while a player stands and waits outside until
    someone sees them; this will happen less and
    less as you practice and as the players improve
    their peripheral vision. The exciting part of this
    is when the coach sees one of their players
    make the right pass quickly in a game situation
    due to the work they have done in this session.
8. Variation: Introduce defenders to this session
    but maintain the attacking overload.

Passing/Support and Running with

and without the Ball: Long Passing

1. You can use various numbers of players at each
    end of the grid in this sequence. Pass and move in
    own grid until eye contact with a player in the other
    grid (or a call), then play a long pass to that player.
2. Balls are constantly changing grids; players
    have to have awareness in their own grid to

receive the ball, but also awareness of when a
pass is on the way from the other grid (must have
head up and be constantly looking around to
see this). If they don’t observe where their own
teammates are or where those in the other grid
are, they won’t be successful with this so they
must play with their head up and have the
ability to look away from the ball as well as at
it, observing all the options that are available
both in their own grid and the other one.

3. Conditions: Ball can’t bounce between grids
    for chipped or lofted passes, or must be driven
    along the ground with pace for quick passing.
4. Develop running with the ball across the grids.
    Pass and move within own grid, then a player
    picks a moment to run and takes it. Keep
    balance of balls in each grid. Can start with
    one in each; try to avoid two in one grid at
    once. Increase to two balls per grid.
5. Long pass, then follow the ball (supporting the
    pass) into the other grid so not only balls are
    being transferred but also players. Players must
    move as quickly as possible to support in the
    other grid.

Passing then Supporting the Pass

7 8


_132 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Third Man Running Development

6. Variation: The type of runs to be made are
    straight or diagonal runs. Diagonal passes and
    straight runs, and diagonal runs and straight
    passes as above or diagonal runs and diagonal
    passes. Equate the situation with how to make
    it difficult for defenders in a game to mark
    players who make different types of runs.
7. If a player makes a run and doesn’t receive a
    pass, then they work their way back into their
    own grid. Relate the move to a player making a
    forward run, they don’t get the pass, they work
    back, draw a defender with them and then
    another player makes the run into the space
    left to receive a through ball.
8. Receiving and turning: A player moves out of
    the area and positions side on at an angle to
    receive and turn (looking before receiving) and
    take the ball to the other grid. The same can
    happen on the other side.
9. Give and go (movement in two’s): A player
    moves into the neutral zone (with a third man
    running off the ball) and another player on the
    ball passes to them. The passer then follows
    and receives a pass back (a 1-2 move) and
    then passes the ball into the other grid, both

players move into the other grid and join in. On
entering, the existing players in this grid must
balance things and look to break in twos the
other way as soon as possible.

10. Introduce a defender in each grid. 4v1 – only
    one ball per grid. As the number of players
    involved increases so do the number of balls
    used. So at times, two players can be making
    moves across the free space from the same
    grid at the same time, hence there is constant
    movement between grids. The players will get
    good at passing and moving and being able
    to look beyond the ball and at the same time
    making quick decisions the more they practice
    this session.

Passing and Support Directional
Target Game

1. Start with two balls and two teams passing
    and playing through each other with no
    opposition. Develop by having two balls per
    team to work with. Have the players play in a
    relaxed yet composed way. Develop this into a
    competitive game.
2. This is a 4v4 target game (you can vary the
    number of players). Players must get the ball
    to their own end targets; if they do, they
    retain possession as a reward. Before they can
    go back to a target, they must pass the ball
    back into their own half of the field. Targets
    have two touches and can pass to any of the
    four players. Players can use support on the
    outside (1 or 2 touch). Inside players have no
    touch restriction.
3. This is an intense workout with little rest. Keep
    it short so players perform with quality, rotate
    outside players in. If a team wins the ball back
    in their attacking half, they can go directly to
    their targets (same as regaining the ball in the

(^9) attacking half and shooting for goal).


_Recognizing the Moment_

_Techniques  Tactics 133_

4. Observe the attacking team: recognize the
    movement off the ball. For example, to work
    the ball into their own half, see if the players
    make runs early. Some should support short
    and some long so the target has choices.
5. Observe the defending team: See if they are
    stuck to the ball or if they recognize runs off
    the ball and track players making runs away
    from the ball into the other half.
6. To lessen the workload and keep everyone
    involved, have players switch with targets and
    outside players when they pass to them.

If done properly with the correct progression, the
Target Game can be a useful tool to teach your team a
number of very important concepts.

Attacking as a Team and as Individuals

- Creating space by running off the ball to
    receive or help a teammate receive.
- Developing quick support play, working angles
    and distances incorporating switching the ball
    using the side players.
- Passing long and short to targets and to
    teammates.
- Receiving and turning in tight situations and
    dribbling in 1v1situations.
       - Lots of touches on the ball for the players in
          this practice.
       - Quick decision-making is required in this
          session because the numbers are small, the
          area tight and the transitions rapid.

Defending as a Team and as Individuals

- Pressuring players on the ball to regain
    possession.
- Supporting pressuring players and tracking
    runners off the ball.
- High pressure to regain possession in the
    attacking half to be able to go straight to the
    target to score.

The coach can also teach transitions from defense
to attack and attack to defense, quick decision
making and improved concentration as the
transition takes place. The players also learn about
interchange of position, how to play the target and
how to support the ball. The coach can concentrate
the drill on one of these areas by changing the
conditions. A change of conditions changes the
focus of the game. For example:

1. No restriction on touches, then three, two
    or one touch, but only if it is okay to do so.
    Introduce a neutral player to create a 5v4
    overload in the middle if players are having
    trouble with possession.
2. Interchange of players outside to in, inside to
    out, as they pass the ball observing the quality
    of the pass and the first touch of the receiver.
3. For quick transition, have one teammate at
    each end so you are attacking both ends but
    once you have passed to one target, you keep
    possession and must try to get to the other
    target. You can’t go back unless the opposition
    wins the ball, then you get it back. Only then
    can you go back to the same target.
4. To lessen the workload and keep everyone
    involved, have players switch with targets and

10


_134 The Best of Soccer Journal_

outside players when they pass to them. This
causes a constant transition of players and
improves the player’s concentration. The team
can only score if they get an overlap, crossover
or 1-2, etc., during the build up.

5. No talking so players have to rely on their own
    vision to play.
6. Players move into the target zone to receive the
    ball so we don’t play with actual targets; different
    players can then become the target player.
7. Man-Marking: Have the players man mark so
    they must track a player when they don’t have
    the ball and they must lose their marker when
    they have the ball. This is a good test to see
    who is working hard and who isn’t as they have
    a designated job to do. You, as a coach, can
    see who works to get free of their marker and
    who works hard to prevent the player they are
    marking from getting the ball.

As coaches, we must teach players to establish in
their minds what to do with the ball before they
receive it. Players must look before they receive
the ball to see their options. These activities are
designed to increase player anticipation and, as a
result, player awareness. Players must learn to read
the game. This includes how the ball is arriving,
from where it is arriving, where the opponents are,
where teammates are and what is beyond the ball.
The following activities suggest methods to move
this type of training into total team training and
the development of positions and team shape.

Small-Sided Game 8v8
Developmental Session with
Composure Zones to Aid
Development

1. Overload at the back. Two forwards can’t
    encroach into the 5-yard composure zone.
    Defenders pass ball across the zone under no

pressure until one is free to run it out. Attackers
can now try to win it back.

2. Players stay in own zone to keep their shape.
    Support in front and behind.
3. Open it up so players can move between zones.
4. Defenders can take the ball back into the
    composure zone for safety, and this encourages
    spreading out and playing from the back. Be
    patient, keep possession, go forward at the
    correct moment.
5. Defenders: spreading out, running with the
    ball, passing the ball, supporting the keeper,
    keep possession, decision-making.
Midfield: receiving and turning, switching play,
    linking play, runs, keep possession, creating
    space, decision-making.
Forwards: as above, also supporting short and
    long, diagonal runs in front of the ball, holding
    the ball up, lay offs, dribbles\shots, quick
    decision-making.
6. As ball advances, players at the back move up.
    Keep checking positions and shape of the team.

11


_Recognizing the Moment_

_Techniques  Tactics 135_

7. To get full game started, have one team standing
    still and let the other team play through them to
    get a feel for how to build up the play.
8. Develop this by having both teams with a ball
    each playing through each other where they
    are not under the pressure of losing the ball.

Development into a 3-2-2 System

1. Play offside from thirds. Players interchange
    between zones one at a time, always returning
    to original set-up. Check the balance of the
    team with and without the ball. Create a 3v2
    in midfield zone with player (2) moving up.
    Could play the ball into attacking third and
    maybe player (6) joins in to make a 3v3.
2. Player (2) fills his place in midfield. If the team
    loses possession, players either drop back in or
    you can develop the session to include pressing
    to regain the ball. (For example, if a team is
    losing the game, go high-pressure and leave
    three players in attacking third, two in midfield
    third and two in defensive third. DEVELOP.
3. Condition: can only score if all players are
    over the defensive third line. Keep compact
    vertically.
       4. Restrict number of touches on the ball (if they
          are able to do so) to encourage quick passing
          and to improve the speed of decision-making.
       5. Vary play by encouraging defenders to pass
          directly to the forwards: midfield players can
          then support them facing the opponent’s goal
          (easier to support than to receive and turn with
          the ball).
       6. If you have problems making the session work
          with equal numbers, then reduce the game
          to an 8v5 situation using one forward, one
          midfielder, two defenders and a keeper on
          the opponent‘s team until the players are
          comfortable, then go into the full workout.

Positional Development

Coaching Points

1. Player (5) is on the ball. (8) comes short to receive,
    defender tracks, space is created in behind. Player
    (6) does a diagonal run to receive the pass.
2. If defender-marking (8) stays (doesn’t track
    8), (5) can pass to (8)’s feet who can turn and
    attack 1v1, or (5) can play it wide.
12

13


_136 The Best of Soccer Journal_

3. In possession, (3) and (4) push out to leave
    opponents offside.
4. Transition — we lose possession and, for
    example, (6) and (5) finish in front of (8) and
    (7) up the field; (8) and (7) defend midfield.

Possible Passing Options

5. Player (5) on the ball. Three possible options
    to pass forward (e.g., to (6), (7) or (2) who
    continue the runs). If (5) cannot make this
    pass, (5) can go to the side to (8) or back to
    (3), (4) and the keeper to keep possession until
    the situation allows for a forward pass again
    (you won’t obviously get all these options to
    pass but it shows how it can work).
6. Caution: in attack, be aware of quick counter-
    attack if opponents win the ball, i.e., we have a
    2v2 at the back.
7. Discussion: you can get so much work into
    this session; every time you look, there may
    be a new situation to discuss. Choose a theme
    and stick with it. When you have established it
    with the players, only then move onto another
    theme.

Training Session to Practice
Team Shape

1. Two balls, a ball each team, shadow play, but
    with opposition to play against. Each team
    takes up their positions based on the position
    of their own ball, not the opponents’.
2. Effectively, there are two separate games going
    on. Initially, have the players stay in their thirds
    to establish a team, then open it up. Have a
    game with two balls being used to play.

## Sharpening Field Vision

Players can learn to study the field through exercises

_The following are some technical-tactical exercises
developed and presented at the 1999 NSCAA
Convention._

T

he coaching exercises focus on how coaches
can help improve players’ field vision.

Exercise 1, presenter: Matt Driver, technical
director, South Jersey Barons. Diagram # 1

- 25 x 40-yard field divided into two halves.
- Two teams of six, players numbered from 1 to 6.
- Each group has two balls and plays in its
    own half.

Passing by numbers

- Each group dribbles both balls simultaneously.
    Each player must pass to the next in numerical
    sequence: 1 passes to 2, 2 to 3 ... 6 to 1, etc.
- Same as above, but with three balls in motion
    at once. Players 1, 3 and 6 start with balls.
- Same as above, but both groups play
    simultaneously in the same (slightly larger) half.

Variations

- Three groups of four playing simultaneously in
    the same space.
- Same as above, but with two or three balls per
    group.

Exercise 2, presenter: Matt Driver. Diagram # 2

- 30 x 20-yard field.
- Three teams of four, with different color jerseys.
- Three balls.

8v4 with three balls

- Two of the groups team up as outside players
    (attackers) to keep the three balls away from
    the third group as long as possible.
- If the defenders win a ball, they immediately
    return it to the attackers.
- Each defender keeps track of his wins. After
    three minutes (and on active rest period), a
    different group rotates into the middle. Which
    group ends up with the most wins?

_138 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Variations

- 4v2, free play, but with two balls at once.
- Players limited to two touches.

Exercise 3, presenter: Tony DiCicco, head coach,
U.S. Women’s National Team. Diagram # 3

- 25 x 35-yard field.
- Three teams of four, with different color jerseys.
- Extra balls provided.

8v4 in three groups

- Two of the groups team up as attackers to keep
    the ball away from the third group as long as
    possible.
- If the defenders win the ball, players
    immediately switch roles. The defenders
    become attackers, and the attackers who lost
    the ball become the new defenders.
- The 8v4 continues uninterrupted while two
    of the groups team up as attackers to keep
    the ball away from the third group as long as
    possible.
- If the defenders win the ball, players switch
    roles immediately.
- Because the teams are of different sizes, the
    situation is constantly changing; when the

team of two is in the middle, it’s 6v2, otherwise
it’s 5v3.

- Attackers’ touches are limited according to the
    situation; they can play freely when it’s 5v3 but
    have only two touches when it’s 6v 2.

Variations

- Attackers limited to two touches regardless of
    the situation.
- Field size adjusted according to skill level.

_The Neutral Player Concept_

_Techniques  Tactics 139_

## The Neutral Player Concept

Alan Maher

A

coaching technique that can ensure
successful practice sessions

One of the devices used by coaches to ensure
that the objective of a soccer training sessions is
achieved is to use certain restrictions so that the
technique or tactic that is the focal point of the
session has a good chance to be successful. One
coaching technique that is highly successful is
the use of the neutral player. Following are some
ways in which the neutral player concept can be
incorporated into your practices.

What is a neutral player? It is the extra player
who always plays with the team with the ball.
Why use the neutral player in training? In a game
where a team gains ball possession, it immediately
tries to gain numerical superiority. Players must
learn to recognize this and take advantage. The
transition from defense to attack must be quick
and efficient. The real measure of a team’s
effectiveness is how it can exploit the capture of
the ball and put itself into the opposing teams
defensive third. In practice, when both teams have
even numbers, the players struggle to maintain
ball possession. Use of the neutral player aids in
teaching these transitional and tactical skills. What
are the functions of the neutral player? To give the
attacking team numerical superiority and to help
in the organizational transition of shifting from
defense to attack.

During training, the neutral player (NP) must wear
a vest or shirt of a different color so he/she can be
easily recognized. The NP cannot be marked man
to man. The NP cannot score goals and should
be rotated often. The NP plays like a regular field
player with certain guidelines or restrictions that
are imposed by the coach. This article will provide

examples of how these restrictions can be imposed.
Restrictions may include:

- When a team gains possession of the ball, the
    first pass must go to the NP. This pass allows the
    neutral player to control the flow of the game.
- NP must pass to the team in control of the ball
- NP must dribble before he/she passes the ball
- NP must take two touches
- NP must take one touch
- NP’s first pass must be square or back
- NP’s first pass must be forward
- The NP must touch the ball before the
    attacking team can score
- The NP must change the point of attack

As noted, the coach must determine what
restrictions are to be applied. Typically, two-touch
passing comes before one-touch passing and
changing the point of attack.

On the Sidelines

The NP does not always have to play on the
field. He/she can play on the sideline or end
line. The players on the sidelines (sideline NPs)
of the training field have certain duties and
responsibilities:

- The sideline NP cannot enter the field of play
- The NP must pass to the team in control of
    the ball
- The NP must remain stationary in a corner or
    assigned area
- The NP must run along the sideline following
    the ball
- The NP must pass to another NP if changing
    the field of play is the objective
- As an option, the NP can pass to another NP
    if the pass to a field teammate is not possible


_140 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Again, the coach must determine the duties and
responsibilities of the NP. In Diagram # 1, you can
see the NPs on the sideline.

Types of Games

There are three types of games that can be played
using the NP methodology.

1. Games with goals
    - Regulation goals – what the players face
       in a real game
    - Mini goals – cones can serve as goal
       markers; these goals should be between 36

and 40 inches wide

- Combination of both
2. Line soccer
- Score by dribbling over the end line
- No score if passing or shooting over end line
-
3. Keepaway:
- Score by combining on a given number of
passes, i.e., 5 passes = 1 point
- Score by maintaining ball possession for a
given period of time

Field Size

The size of the field should vary according to the
age and experience of the players. A good rule of
thumb is to multiply the number of players on one
team by 10 yards. Thus a game of 2v2 should be
played in an area 20 yards long or 5v5 in a 50
yard long field. The field should be longer than it is
wide. For our above examples: 20 x 15 and 50 x 40.

Going to Goal

With regulation goals, use goalkeepers. With mini
goals, no goalkeepers are to be used. Field players
cannot stand in mini goals.

Toward Mini Goals 1v1 (2v1)

Two opposing players have support from one NP

Objective: Use the neutral player to penetrate
and score
Number of Players: 3
Field size: 30 yards long by 15 or 20 yards
Rules: NP may pass the ball only to the player with

One Against One (3v1)

Two opposing players have support of a
neutral player on each touchline

Objective: Attack the goal with support on both
sides
Number of players: 4
Field size: Length 20 yards, with width 15 yards
Rules: NP may pass the ball only to the players
with last ball possession. GK’ers must release the
ball to his/her own team
Very important: The 1v1 games are very
demanding. Rotate players often.

Two Against Two (4v2)

The attacking team has support from a NP on
each touchline

Objective: Attack the goal with support on each side
Number of players: 6 field players and 2
goalkeepers
Field size: Length is 50 yards, and width is 40
yards
Rules: Both NPs must stay off field of play.
Goalkeepers must release ball to his/her own
teammates.

Remarks: After two minutes, the NPs must replace
a team on te field. The NPs must stay even with
the ball.

Summary

As coaches can see from these few examples,
the use of the NP in training of teams can be
very valuable. A reminder to all coaches that the
exercises in themselves are valuable but must be
prescribed based on the age and playing maturity
of the team.

These games have stressed combination play. But
a coach need use only his/her imagination to
incorporate the NP into other training games.

the world of soccer. He has published many articles
and soccer books. He has been a strong advocate
of the Dutch soccer culture.

## Small Group Practice

If well planned, they can be very valuable

Rolf Mayer
This was first published in the April 2000 issue of Success in Soccer.

Suggestions for practice

N

o small-group practice, no matter how
interesting and carefully designed, can
replace practice with the full team. Coaches
need to remind players of the benefits of regular
practice, penalize them for absences and
constantly work to improve participation. The best
way to attract and motivate players is engaging,
“play-oriented” practice.

The following sample exercises are most appropriate
for the main section of the practice session.
Remember: Small-group games (even old favorites
like 4v2 and 5v2 keep-away games) must come
after a warm-up period (running and stretching).

Small practice groups mean exercises with small
groups. With regard to training efficiency, this
actually can be advantageous. However, the coach
must also keep in mind that small-group practice
is considerably more intense, physically, for the
individual players. Always combine short exercise
periods with long, active rest periods.

This also means that a small-group practice session
should always close with a cool-down period to
help players recover.

Player absences aren’t the only reason to have
small group practices. The following exercises work
just as well in special sessions scheduled outside
regular practice times.

## Off the Shoulder Movement for Strikers

Wayne Harrison
November – December 2008

I

t is important for coaches to take time to work
with their strikers individually and in small
groups to teach them the correct movement(s).

Individual Striker Movements —
Diagram # 1

The three possible movements of strikers:

- Short to go long (opposite run)
- Long to come short (opposite run)
- Off the shoulder of the defender.

In the above diagram, we can see all three
movements. In movement A) the striker takes the
defender toward the ball to create space behind,
either for himself or a teammate. In B), the striker
takes the defender away to create space in front
and short to check back into for herself or a
teammate. In C), the striker runs away and invites
a ball off or over the shoulder of the defender, in
this situation the striker is off the right shoulder
of the defender.

The ball may be delivered off (outside) the right
shoulder of the defender so it goes wider, or
(inside) the left shoulder of the defender so the
striker cuts inside the defender either in front
or behind them, or moves toward the ball and
receives the ball to feet.

“Off the Shoulder” has Three
Additional Movements to Consider
— Diagram # 2

Carrying the idea of off the shoulder, the striker in
this position has three possibilities for moves, each
of which help the striker to end up in a position
where they are facing forward the goal:

- Away from the defender (A), then back across
    the defender either in front of them or behind
    them for the delivery inside the defender. If the
    defender checks away with the striker, then
    the striker checks back inside to their right; the

1

2


_Off the Shoulder Movement for Strikers_

_Techniques  Tactics 155_

defender’s left always is facing forward. If not
checked by the defender, the striker attacks
behind the defender for the diagonal pass
inside the defender’s start position.

- Moving and staying off the shoulder (B) for
    the delivery outside the defender to attack,
    the player on the ball plays a diagonal pass
    over the shoulder of the defender into the path
    of the striker facing forward. The striker, by
    making this move, opens up the angle for the
    pass and gets in line still with the defender so
    as not to be offside but again facing forward,
    ready to attack the pass in front of them.
- Going short (C) to the ball to receive the
    delivery to feet after first moving not toward
    but away from the defending player and the
    ball, and ending up facing forward. In this
    case, the defender should “drop off” to cover
    himself so the striker can’t make a run behind
    him, but this is the cue for the striker to check
    to the ball from a wider angle and more open
    body stance so he receives the ball at his feet;
    but facing forward with space to run at the
    defender; not with his back to goal and with
    his back to the defender. The first movement
    helps this space be created.

What Usually Happens...

Diagram # 3 shows the usual position of the
strikers; they stand alongside the defender and do
not open the angle up to help them receive a pass.
Here are the disadvantages to this:

- The striker has his back to the defender.
    Defender has control.
- The striker‘s body position is square on to
    t h e b a l l , d e f e n d e r a n d t h e g o a l , f a c i n g b a c k.
    The striker can’t see the defender clearly, nor
    see the goal directly.
- If the ball is played in behind the defender, the
    striker has to first turn, then run forward and
    probably is second best to the ball against the
    defender who has a yard or two start and is
    probably side on already so only needs to do
    half a turn.
- It is easy for the defender to mark the striker as
    he or she can see the ball and the striker at the
    same time and be in control of the situation.

Individual Striker Movement
off the Shoulder

The striker moves “off the shoulder” of the
defender. Only a matter of a few yards can open up
a wonderful space and attacking opportunities. In

3

4


_156 The Best of Soccer Journal_

this case, moving off the shoulder of the defender
means there is a space behind the defender that
the player on the ball can deliver the ball into. If
the defender does not adjust his position, this is
a great chance to receive the ball and attack the
goal. If that happens, the striker is now:

- Facing forward, and off at an angle, not
    having to turn and run forward. This saves
    time and puts the defender at a disadvantage.
- The striker can see the ball, the goal and the
    defender at the same time.
- The striker can even take their position off
    the sweeper in an offside position, if the
    opposition employs one, so they are almost
    in advance but also wide of the marking
    defender. This position (off the shoulder) is
    very difficult to defend.
- If not facing forward, at least be in a side on
    position so they can see forward and not have
    their back to the defender.

In Diagram # 5, the striker moves “off the
shoulder” of the defender. The defender comes
with the striker and closes them down. Now the
timing of the pass and timing of the run come into
play. The striker then checks back inside into the
space the defender has vacated and attacks inside
and across in front of the defender. The second

striker (9) can run off the other center back (B) to
create the space inside also. The player on the ball
plays it inside the center back. The striker should
understand that the best time to make the cut is
when the defender plants his right foot down (and
be flat-footed even) and is leaning forward and
toward the striker. That is the time to check back
inside and across the defender. The defender is
likely to be most off balance at this time.

In Diagram # 6, the striker moves “off the
shoulder” of the defender. This is the same as the
previous Diagram # in which the defender closes
the striker down, but this time the striker makes
a run outside and behind the defender rather
than inside and across him. The timing of this is
important for being on side.

Working Opposites with Movement
of the Strikers

The strikers must recognize when the man on the
ball has time to play the ball forward. Strikers
move toward the ball, dragging the man marking
defenders close to them. As the player checks
toward the passer as if to receive a pass and is
marked tightly by the defender, a sharp spin is
made to receive a long pass behind into the space
created by coming short. A sharp turn/spin into

5

6


_Off the Shoulder Movement for Strikers_

_Techniques  Tactics 157_

the defender and across the shoulder is the best
move rather than the old arc run into space. The
old arc run is easily tracked by the defender as
there is time to see the ball and the player. When
the player has time on the ball to pass, expect
lots of movement at pace, e.g., short to go long.
The midfield player can pass down the side of the
striker. When there’s no time on the ball, i.e., they
must pass quickly, expect players to stay in their
positions to provide options. This means if they
go short to receive, they get the ball to feet from
the first run because there is no time to make the
second run as the player on the ball has to release
it quickly.

Working Opposites Checking Back
to Receive the Ball

In Diagram # 8, communication is important.
The midfield players need to know the strikers
are playing opposites. This time the strikers are
moving away to come back. Again there is time on
the ball for the midfield player and the opposite
movement comes into effect, both working off
the second run. But if the midfielder has no time,
the striker knows it will be played first time into
the first run. The opposite movement is if the
striker shows to receive to feet, he/she is going
to spin away and receive in space in front of
them in the form of a through ball. If he/she runs
away, then expect a check back to feet. This is
especially effective when the strikers are not too
close together, so there’s lots of space in which to
work. To make the movement clearer, the strikers
can have a code word to call as a signal so the
player on the ball knows what is happening. They
call it as early as possible.

No Time on the Ball to Wait
for the Second Run

This situation happens in Diagram # 9 more often
in a game. There is no time on the ball and the
passer has to release the ball quickly because of

7

8

9


_158 The Best of Soccer Journal_

pressure on the ball from (C). In this case, the
striker must recognize this, act accordingly and
expect a pass from their first run. In this case, with
(10), it can be a run inviting a ball to be played
down the side into the channel for the striker to run
on to. In the case of (9), it is a pass to feet coming
short to receive. The pass can be made from
wide areas, too, with the same conditions passing
off the first run or passing off the second run
depending on the time on the ball of the passer or
if the striker has given the code word signal. In a
game, the team could be prepared to play on the
basis that it always makes the pass off the first run
unless the players get a call from the striker using
the code word to carry out the opposite movement.
It isn’t always possible in split-second situations to
recognize how much time a player has on the ball
so it may be best just to work the movement off
a call.

No Time on the Ball to Wait for
a Second Run

In Diagram # 10, the ball is in a wide position on
the field, and the same principles apply to receiving
off the first pass, as above (10) down the side to
space to run on to and (9) to feet. Here, the passer
must release the pass early (because of pressure
on the ball) or they have not received the code

word signal to perform the opposite move. In a
game situation, for the first 30 minutes, it could
be a game plan in which the strikers always work
off a pass from the first run and get the defenders
conditioned into thinking that is always the case,
saving the decisive moment for later in the game
when the code word signal is called and the players

10


_Off the Shoulder Movement for Strikers_

_Techniques  Tactics 159_

work the opposite move receiving from the second
run. It may be they only have to do it once in a
game and it results in a goal, giving the striker a
vital second or fractions of a second thus gaining
a couple of yards on the defender in a vital area of
the field to receive a pass and score a goal.

Training Exercise to Practice the
Opposite Movement

Here, in Diagram # 11, the striker comes short
and shows for the ball asking for a pass from (D).
Defender (F) follows. The midfielder (D) passes to
(C), (D) then passes over the top or a through ball
into (E)’s path as he/she spins.
The defender must play passively. To continue the
work once player (E) receives the ball, they must
beat (F) back to the touchline. Players (C) and (D)
go to the middle, and the next two take their place.
As the pass is going from (D) to (C) the striker
shouts the code word and spins to receive the pass
as player (C) is about to pass it. The shout must
be early to (C) to make the pass at the exact same
time (E) is spinning to receive it.

Variations: The player receiving the pass can get
it “short” or “long” to keep the defender guessing.
He/she should get it short, when the code word is
not used, but the player could use any other word
to confuse. He/she should receive it long, when
the actual code word is used. Combine with the
passer to beat the defender.

## The Goal: Causing Havoc

By creating space for themselves, flank players can
get behind the defense

This was first published in the May 2000 _Soccer Journal_

The following is an outline of a presentation by
Glenn Myernick made to the NSCAA National
Academy coaches at its staff training weekend in
San Antonio, Texas, in May.

C

oach Myernick noted that flank players are
generally seen as competent in several areas
of functional play such as individual and collective
defending, maintaining possession and creating
width, but that a major shortcoming has been the
ability to work with supporting players to create
space for themselves.

Through the creation of space, flank players can
begin to understand and incorporate into their
games the ability to penetrate the opposition; that
is, get behind the defense and create havoc in the
final third of the field.

Warm-up/technical practice

In Diagram # 1, six players have been placed in a
grid 12 by 16 yards. The objective of the exercise
is to have the players sharpen their control and
passing skill and improve the timing of their runs to
both collect and receive the ball.

In the first phase, Player No. 1 sends a ball across
to Player No. 2, who comes to meet the pass, controls
it on the first touch and plays it back to No. 1. No. 2
then bends a run away and No. 1 controls and, on
the second touch, plays a well-weighted ball into
No. 2’s path and runs to take No. 2’s place on the
grid. No. 3 now views the action between Nos. 1
and 2 and, as No. 2 collects the ball, times a run
to collect a pass, plays it back to No. 2 and moves
away to collect the return pass and now combine
with No. 4, etc. No. 2 replaces No. 3, etc.

Each player seeks to first control, then pass the
ball. The quality of the pass (accuracy, pace) must
be emphasized to the players, and gradually they
can be asked to increase the speed of movement
in the exercise.

The coach can now reverse the direction of the
passing. The players can then be asked to first
time all their passes with reversal of the flow of the
exercise to take place using this restriction as well.

Three grids should be set up on the field with six
players assigned to each. The central grid may
be used by the coach to demonstrate each of the

(^1) variations in the exercise. About 10 yards should


_The Goal: Causing Havoc_

_Techniques  Tactics 161_

be allowed between the grids for safety purposes
(Diagram # 2).

Match-related exercises

Myernick then established three larger (20 X 40
yards) grids with cones, two on the perimeter of the
field and a third in the middle of the other half of
the field (Diagram # 2 for location of grids). Four
players (two in red, two in blue) are initially involved.

He pointed out that the two players on the ends
of the grids might be viewed as the left back
and a center back respectively. The player on
the touch-line (No. 1) is the focal point of the
exercise, with the objective to free that individual
to penetrate into the final third of the field. The
fourth player (No. 2) must coordinate with No. 1 in
bringing that about.

Diagram # 3 depicts No. 1 timing a run to the ball
and playing it back to the LB. At this point, the
back at the other end of the grid shows for the ball
and lays it off to No. 1, who has sprinted into open
space. Players now resume their places on the grid
and this pattern is repeated in the other direction
with No. 2 replicating No. 1’s pattern.

In Diagram # 4, Myernick introduced a passing
subtlety when he noted that the LB can “signal” to

No. 1 (when it is clear that No. 1 is being tightly
marked) by a “soft ball” to his feet that is intended
to tell him that once No. 1 returns the ball, a ball
to space behind the aggressive defender is “on”
and so No. 1 must spin and move to receive the pass.

In Diagram # 5, we see No. 2 being trained with
the supporting back to penetrate the flank, and
while the option demonstrated in Diagram # 4 is
not shown, time can be spent on that as well.

2 3

4


_162 The Best of Soccer Journal_

In Diagram # 6, another variation is shown. The
ball is played to No. 1 who now executes a
takeover with No. 2. On the takeover, No. 2 plays
the ball forward with the receiver able to play the
ball off to either No. 1 or No. 2.

The final option is shown in Diagram # 7. It
involves a pass to No. 1, who executes a crossover
with No. 2. The LB, now overlapping into the space
created by No. 1’s dribble, receives a ball from No.
2 following the crossover.

Myernick positioned himself off the field with
a supply of balls with other balls available at

the opposite end of the grid. From this coaching
position, he could offer comments to both
encourage the players and correct the activity.
In particular, he pointed out that players must
recognize that quality passing is necessary or that
play will break down. At this point, two defenders
(one blue, one red) were introduced and the players
were instructed that if the ball was won by the
defense, the two players must use their supporting
player (LB or B) initially and then seek to penetrate
their flanks.

In Diagram # 8, we see another combination being
trained. Again No. 2 shows to the ball and plays

5

6

7

8


_The Goal: Causing Havoc_

_Techniques  Tactics 163_

it back to LB. Off the ball, No. 1 is making a more
central run, dragging the defender and opening up
space, which is exploited when he sprints to the
exposed space behind the defense to receive a one-
touch pass from the LB. Again, this pattern should
be emphasized going in both directions.

In Diagram # 9, we see the two attacking players
combining to open up space on the flank for player
No. 2. His teammate shows to control and play
the ball back to LB. As this is taking place, No. 2
draws the defender and, as the LB receives the ball,
sprints centrally to receive the ball. Here, Myernick
noted, mobility in attack is demonstrated.

While combination play with a supporting player
was emphasized in the grid exercises, Myernick
frequently reminded players and the Academy staff
members that if a flank player can turn with the
ball on the defender, the option to penetrate on
the dribble is a most viable option.

When the dribble option is “on” (no covering
defender), it must be exploited and the decision to
combine with others or dribble is critical.

With six players now active, there was plenty of
opportunity for transition play to take place, with
extra players used to keep the concentration level
of the players keen. From time to time, Myernick

would praise the players when good decisions
were made. When technical or tactical misplays
occurred, they were pointed out.

Again, the coach reminded the staff that three
such grids could be set up on the field so that if
they were training their teams, a large group could
be trained simultaneously.

6v6+2

The next training exercise was a two-goal game
that was played on a 84 x 36 yard field. The main
buildup area was 60 x 36 yards with two 12-yard
zones at either end of the field. Two goals (marked
by flags and cones) were placed at the sides of the
fields, each 12 yards in width.

Two neutral players (in yellow) played with the
team having ball possession, and the emphasis was
on working to get the ball and players free on the
flanks of the field. A team scored when a ball or a
player and the ball were played through either of
its goals and the ball stopped inside the end zone.
Play then proceeded in the opposite direction.

Initially, both teams failed to establish a target
player up top and the coach instructed them to do
so in order to stretch the defense vertically. After
that, play opened up a bit, though keeping players

9 10


_164 The Best of Soccer Journal_

wide as free play took place proved difficult at
times. Here, players must understand that everyone
may find themselves in wide positions (again the
issue of mobility) and recognize the various options
at their command that can free themselves.

A typical sequence is shown in Diagram # 10,
where the neutral player is shown combining with
a back, and the flank player has timed a check to
the ball with a run into space to receive a layoff.

Myernick noted that, depending on the ability
in the team, the exercise may be varied by: 1)
expanding the space to 44 yards (the width of the
penalty box); or 2) making the exercise 5v5+2; or

    combining both options. In the 6v6+2 and in
    the concluding 9v9 exercise, the offside rule should
    be observed.

8v8 plus keepers

Myernick concluded the session with an 8v8
game with goalkeepers on a field that was full
length (Diagram # 11). With markers, he initially
established outside lanes in which only the flank
players could operate and then removed that
restriction.

Teams were awarded two points for penetration
down a flank, five points when a goal was scored

either from the flank or a goal from a pass from the
flank, and three points for a goal scored and/or
built up from a central position.

Conclusion

Myernick wrapped up the training session by
reviewing the players‘ various options in terms
of freeing themselves or their teammates on the
flanks. It is crucial for both players and coaches
to recognize that passing and receiving technique
must be perfect in order for any of the tactics to
take place in the game and that the initial phase
of the practice, the technical segment, must see the
players concentrating to achieve perfection in order
for the practice to achieve maximum results.

1976 Hermann Award while playing at Hartwick
College. He played in the NASL, captained the U.S.
National Team and has coached at the college and

_Maintaining Possession_

_Techniques  Tactics 165_

## Maintaining Possession

The key is employing tactics that utilize all of the players

Steve Dawson

Introduction

T

he fastest and most direct way of moving
the ball from one end of the field to the
other is to have the goalkeeper (GK) punt it, and
many teams and coaches choose this method of
transition. A number of teams have been very
successful utilizing this method.

However, I contend that to develop skilled players
in defense, midfield and up-front, coaches need to
play out of defense and through the midfield rather
than bypassing it.

The following explores methods and tactical
principles of how to move the ball from the back to
the front utilizing all the players on the field.

Purpose

Move the ball from the back to the attacking
third, at least over the halfway line, maintaining
“good possession,” i.e., the ball under control and
supporting players for the person with the ball.

Situations – options

- GK distribution – GK to sweeper, GK to
    fullbacks, GK to the midfield, GK to forwards.
- Sweeper distribution – sweeper to fullbacks,
    sweeper to the midfield, sweeper to forwards.
- Distribution by backs – backs to the midfield,
    backs to the forwards.

Note: Under this system of play, the center back is
pushed into midfield as a link between defense and

midfield. Therefore, we have a back three rather
than a back four – of course, this should be flexible
and can become a back-four if necessary.

Key points:

A. Players, even defenders, must be
comfortable with the ball and ability to:

1. Control the ball under pressure
2. Pass ball under pressure
3. See players in support
4. Run with ball into space, drawing players to
    them

B. Supporting players make intelligent
runs with emphasis on:

1. Timing of the run
2. Angle of support
3. Making the field big (opposition will try to
    make field small)

C. Create space by:

1. Interchanging positions
2. Moving the ball quickly
3. Switching play
4. Making overlapping runs

Practices

- Functional practices for specific defenders –
    GK, sweeper and full backs.
- Functional practices for back three or back four.
- Functional practices for defense and midfield.
- Practice for all three units, the whole team.


_166 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Functional practice for
specific defenders

Goalkeeper
Throw

Organization
Ball is played in from corners, crosses, shots, long-
ball, etc. GK catches the ball and throws out to
breaking fullbacks or sweeper, then to breaking
midfield. At first no opposition, then opposition.

Teaching points
Look early; get in position early, preferably wide;
if available, utilize space in front; don’t take too
many chances.

Punt and goal kick

Organization
Short goal kick – just practice with three or four
defenders and pressure from opposition. Obviously,
the kick has to be taken quickly. The object here is
for defenders to receive the ball and try to hit the
midfield who should be moving and supporting.

Teaching points
Prepare early; fullbacks come wide to give
themselves room and create space for the sweeper
at the top of the box, if the GK chooses to use

him/her; midfield be aware and make themselves
available; angle of support is crucial, not square;
don’t lose possession in defending third.

Long goal kick and punt

Organization
Work with the GK hitting the target players,
preferably the halfway line or beyond. Two options:
one-touch flick-on or lay-off to the side, or control
facing your own goal – depends on the service
and skill of the player receiving the ball. Flick-on
has GK hitting two or three target players who are
positioned somewhere near the halfway line. No
opposition to begin with, then gradually increase.

Teaching points
Option 1: Flick-on – get in front of defender; hit
channels; don’t head ball straight up in the air; be
prepared to use other parts of body other than the
head; supporting runners move before the header
or flick-on, i.e., anticipate; read the flight of the ball
as there is a tendency for players to make their run
too early and to come too deep so the ball goes
over their head; play to players’ strength, generally
“big people” want the ball played to their head.

Option 2: Control – read flight of ball; take
defender out of position and check back into space;
first touch crucial (balance and positioning); ball

_Maintaining Possession_

_Techniques  Tactics 167_

under control early; shield/screen ball; be aware
of supporting players before receiving the ball;
supporting players moving early and anticipate
the pass; defenders make themselves available
to target players; try not to play square passes or
passes that put players under pressure, especially in
the defending third (e.g., back passes); if possible,
turn defender and utilize space in front of you.

Sweeper and fullbacks

Organization
GK, sweeper, fullbacks and other players (midfield,
one or two target players) with no opposition at
first and gradually increasing opposition pressure.

GK to sweeper who distributes to fullbacks or
midfield.

Teaching points
Sweeper must be aware of space available to him/
her; move into space just beyond top of penalty
area; no more than one touch before turning
with the ball; GK make self available in case of
quick pressure; sweeper must see options laterally
and up the field; first preference should be to
move the ball forward, but not if it means losing
possession; fullbacks support early and only square
if opposition not likely to intercept the pass; quality
pass from GK; GK give instructions to sweeper to

turn or give a return pass; midfield and forwards
have to be mobile in order to get open for pass
from sweeper; sweeper keeps head up to see
option, and do not dribble into trouble, but if space
is available, utilize it.

GK to fullbacks who distribute to midfield,
sweeper or forwards.

Teaching points
Get wide early and don’t run into space too early,
thereby putting yourself under pressure before
even receiving the ball; let the GK know you
want the ball, and let the GK respond in kind

3.2

3.1


_168 The Best of Soccer Journal_

(provide support for back-pass); sweeper, make
yourself available by providing a good angle of
support if midfield and forwards are not open;
move ball quickly to forwards and midfield because
space is usually very tight in the middle third; see
options, either GK, sweeper, center-mid. Outside-
mid, forwards to feet, or hit channels for forwards
to run onto; once fullback has played the ball,
don’t stand, move to support behind or overlap
and get forward.

Functional practice for back 3 or 4

Organization
Just in own half of the field with no opposition at
first then a gradual increase of opposition pressure,
e.g., four defenders and three opponents. Goal here
is to get the ball at least 40-45 yards up the field
under control. Eventually close the field down to
increase the difficulty level for the defense. Give
the defense targets to reach (small goals, one each
on the wings and one in the middle of the field,
just short of the halfway line).

Teaching points
Communication, always know where you are
and who is supporting; GK acts as a player, e.g.,
don’t divorce yourself from the defense; keep your
balance, i.e., angles of support, don’t caught flat
(space), use space in front of you and the width

of the field; don’t give high balls that are hard to
control, and don’t play the ball across the penalty
area, or just beyond; if opposition is close and likely
to intercept, need other options.

Functional practice for defense
and midfield

Organization
Four defenders and three midfield or three
defenders and four midfield. At first, work on
shadow play (walk-through practice), then include
four opposing players. Again, the goal is to get
to the halfway line or just beyond and reach one
of three targets, either wide or in the middle.
Eventually, six opposing players, with the object
of getting the ball beyond the halfway line under
control. If opposing players gain possession, they
can score. Next, same practice except target is a
regular goal so it becomes a 6v6 or a 7v7 game
with the defensive team working on bringing the
ball up the field. If successful, make the field smaller
so space is more of a premium, or condition defense
to two-touch. Play throw-ins as you would in a game.

Teaching points
Communication and movement; GK gets the ball
moving early and provide depth and support; GK
looks to hit the midfield as well as defenders, if
midfield receives the ball, fullbacks provide support

6

_Maintaining Possession_

_Techniques  Tactics 169_

behind and overlap, and midfield should be
prepared to turn with the ball if space is available;
be prepared to interchange, e.g., sweeper or center-
back moves up and other players adjust so cover
exists; play ball wide, but can go up the middle if
space is available; be prepared to switch direction
of play, otherwise opposition will close down the
space and make the field smaller; movement off
the ball, angles of support and quality passing
crucial here; avoid square throw-ins unless space
available, and sweeper and GK be prepared provide
support behind the thrower.

Functional practice for whole team

Practice as noted above, but in 11v11 game
situation. One team has possession with the task of
moving the ball up the field without losing it in the
defending or middle third of the field.

Short throw to sweeper or fullbacks

Organization
GK throws the ball to the sweeper or fullbacks who
look to play through the midfield, e.g., outside-mid
or center-mid. Condition practice to two-touch if
players are not supporting or moving. Can divide
the field into three areas, and score points for
successful movement of ball into each area, e.g.,
one point area, two-point area, three-point area.

Teaching points
If possible, hit midfield early; if too tight, switch
play to create space for midfield, even if it means
using the GK as a support player; as midfield
players receive the ball, defense gives support
behind, yet tell them to turn if they can; forwards
come off marker and look for give-and-go.

Throw-ins in defending third

Organization
Start with the ball in the defending third. Options
are: throw to GK who switches the play; throw to
player supporting behind, i.e., in sweeper position
and go from there; throw ball to feet of forward
player who is checking off defender; throw down
the line for flick-on to target player; throw to
overlapping midfield player.

Teaching points
If possible, take throw quick and to feet; thrower
moves immediately after taking throw; closest
player to the ball takes the throw – doesn’t have
a designated thrower unless it is going to be long;
players moving and supporting for person receiving
the ball; if ball goes to sweeper, players look for
short and long pass; if ball goes to forward player,
look for lay-off, but target player be aware of space
behind them for a turn; if throwing down the line,
someone must be overlapping or moving into space

7

_17 0 The Best of Soccer Journal_

for the flick-on; once in attacking position, third
players get forward for support; when throwing to
overlapping midfield player of defender, timing of
the run and throw is crucial so receiving players are
not running into a crowded area.

Goalkeeper throws to midfield or
forward who is checking back

Organization:
GK hits outside-mid, center-mid or forward target
players.

Teaching points
Quality and timing of the throw are crucial; midfield
and forwards be aware of where space is and how
much time you have; if player cannot turn, play ball
back the way you are facing and reset; if hitting the
outside-mid, who is going forward, don’t wait until
that player is in space before throwing the ball,
i.e., throw the ball in front of the player for him-her
to run onto – if he/she has to wait for the ball, it
defeats the purpose of the practice; once you have
the ball under control in the midfield and attacking
third of play, keep your balance and do not allow
gaps to emerge between forwards, midfield and
defense, i.e., stay tight as a unit as it complements
support on the ball.

_Maintaining Possession_

_Techniques  Tactics 171_

Other points of reference

It is important to note that although the discussion
here deals with retaining possession as the ball
goes from the back to the front of the field, basic
fundamental principles still prevail and should
be emphasized. That is, there is no secret to
keeping the ball – movement off the ball, angles of
support, communication, quality passes, adaptation,
flexibility etc., are all crucial aspects to this exercise
as they are during all phases of the game. While
the emphasis has been designed around specific
functional practices for certain groups of players,
more general exercises and practices can facilitate
the objective, i.e., possession under pressure, in tight
spaces, and movement off the ball.

Small-sided games

These are excellent for developing skills and support
play. Encourage all players, including defenders, to
learn the art of scoring and dribbling. 1v1, 2v2,
3v3, and so on, allow players the opportunity to
experience all facets of the game. As a coach, you
are very fortunate if you have 11 players who can
all distribute with skill. Too many coaches resigned
themselves to the idea that defenders are “out
there” to stop (destroy) and not create. Obviously,
if you have skilled defenders, it will be a lot easier
to maintain possession as you move the ball up the
field. Functional drills are important, but defenders
should not be limited to practices that emphasize
tackling, jockeying, delaying, 30-40 yard passes
to forwards and so on. Incidentally, some of the
best defenders have spent considerable time as
midfield players.

Modified small-sided games

Limit touches: These types of practices can be
modified to suit the need of the team. For example,
if a coach feels the need for more movement and
support, he/she can play three, two or one-touch
to encourage this small-sided games.

No goals: Here, players are rewarded for retaining
possession. A team receives one point for five
consecutive touches and the first team to five or 10
points wins. This is an excellent warm-up game and
fitness drill, and complements the objectives of this
discussion.

More than two goals: Here, players can score in
any of four or five goals. This encourages spatial
awareness, vision, flexibility, and redirection of play.
Coaches can put many stipulations and conditions
on these games to serve their needs, and obviously,
are not restricted to just the above.

Conclusion – philosophy

What is the goal here? That is what the coach must
ask himself/herself. The task is not an easy one –
moving the ball up the field under control while the
opposition imparts pressure and closes down the
space. However, by developing players with skill
and encouraging them to play with confidence in
all areas of the field, the coach will, in my opinion,
facilitate the creation of exciting and innovative
players and imaginative soccer.

Coaches want to win and so do players, but the
long-term goal of developing skilled players is more
important than the short-term goal of winning. Let
players make mistakes by trying to play the game
the way it should be played – to feet, connecting
passes, give-and-goes, switching play, innovative
attacking soccer, and so on. While this sounds
idealistic, I believe it is an important reference
point, and will, in the long run, create more skillful
successful players, and a better game to watch.

## Tactics for the Attack

Exercises focus on play in the final half of the field

Jack Detchon

T

he following is an outline of a session
presented by Jack Detchon to the NSCAA
Academy staff as part of an in-service training
program conducted in May 2004 at Muhlenburg
College

This is a teaching progression that focuses on
development of team attacking tactics in the final
half of the field.

There are some assumptions made in this
presentation:

- The double center striker set-up is the
    alignment chosen by the coach.
- That functional training of the two forwards
    precedes the implementation of this exercise.
    This means there is a bit of understanding as
    to when the supporting forward should create
    space for his teammate, when he/she will show
    for a 1-2, when a possible through ball is “on,”
    as well as when a possible overlap or takeover
    might take place. In other words, combination
    play has been taught and implemented in the
    overall coaching scheme.
- There has been functional/technical training
    between the midfielders and the strikers in
    terms of playing balls to feet or space with the
    strikers making the proper decisions based on
    the pressure by the defender, or their position
    relative to the defender’s positioning.
- Some time has been spent on playing the
    ball wide to outside players with the proper
    supporting runs then made by both strikers
    and supporting midfielders in order to connect
    with flighted balls to either the near or far

posts or balls played behind the defense to
withdrawn attackers.

Once these technical/tactical building blocks
have been established (they might actually serve
as the basis for the warm-up leading into this
activity), then the coach can seek to coach to
perceived problems that are exhibited as these
exercises are implemented.

Exercise I: 2v2 in restricted
goal area

Organization
Use flat cones to define the restricted areas
with the server playing balls to either of the two
forwards to initiate play.

To begin play, the server plays balls to the strikers
and 2v2 play takes place in the restricted area shown.

Objectives

- To review the various phases of combination
    play between the two strikers
- To develop an aggressive attitude to score
    within players
- Creation of space by the forward based on
    quick checks to the ball or by a good first touch
    of the ball
- Use of quick changes of direction or changes of
    pace to free selves
- Develop judgment of angles and distances
    both from each other as well as in relation to
    goal and keeper
- Exhibit quality passing throughout exercise

- Can they receive, turn and recognize when to
    play a 1-2 combination?
- Can they receive, turn and play partner into
    a scoring position via a through ball, via an
    overlap, or initiate takeover?

Exercise II: 3v2 in restricted area

Organization:
Server plays balls to A8 creating a 3v2; X8 recovers
on the second touch of A8.

Objectives

- Build on exercise I
- A8 takes long range shot
- A8 overlaps
- Decoy overlaps creating a 2v1 and allowing A9
    or A10 to turn

Coaching Points: Diagram # 2
Do the players take advantage of their numerical
superiority?

- By attacking aggressively with speed, with
    pace?
- Does the player farthest from ball pull wide to
    create space?
- Can the attacking team maintain the
    momentum of the attack?

Exercise III: 4v3 in restricted area

Organization
Server plays ball A4 or A8, and they combine with
A9 & A10 vs. three defenders (X5, X6, and X8) with
X4 a recovering defender (on second touch of ball
by A4 or A8).

Objectives

- Play the ball forward into the danger area with
    controlled speed.

Coaching Points: Diagram # 3

- Do attacking players maintain maximum width
    but attack as centrally as possible?
- Are early decisions made by midfielders to run
    with or pass the ball?
- Does the team maintain its attacking
    momentum?

Exercise IV: 4v4 with wingers

Organization:
Server plays to 2v2 midfield situation with X2 and
X3 acting as recovering wing backs. A7-A11 are
wingers. Only attacking players may go into the
shaded area (use flat cones to designate). At a
certain point, allow X2 or X3 to chase a winger as
exercise concludes.

Objectives

- Attack with pace centrally to take advantage
    of the bad positions of X2 and X3 (they can
    recover to defend centrally)
- Play wide to A7 or A11 only as a last resort

Coaching Points: Diagram # 4

- If the attack is slowed and ball is played
    wide, is the service of the ball early with pace
    into the second six-yard box (labeled “box”
    on the Diagram #)?
       - Is the early ball played preferably between the
          knee and head height?

Exercise V: 6v8

Organization
Use the full width, half field, six attackers, eight
defenders (one recovering at the start). Whether X8
recovers to A8 and the Xs play with a back four or
X3 pushes forward to A8 and they play with two
defenders and a sweeper is up to the defenders.

_Tactics for the Attack_

_Techniques  Tactics 17 5_

Objective: Diagram # 5

- Can the attacking players make decisions when
    to attack centrally and when to attack wide?

In conclusion, this practice session demands a high
organization and a keen sense of observation by
the coach to ensure that it is of value to the players
and the team.

When to halt the exercise, when to move on to the
next stage, when to place restrictions on players,
etc., must be part of the coach’s methodology in
order for this to be imparted accurately to the team.

Finally, if there are repeated technical breakdowns
in the exercise, then the coach and the team must
get back to fundamentals and correct those errors.
As often stated: “There are no tactics if there is no
technique!”

## Attacking Zonal Defenses

Players must move faster than the zone can shift

Mike Parsons

The following is a recap of a presentation by Mike
Parsons, NSCAA Director of Coaching Education, to
the NSCAA Academy Premier Course.

T

here are major coaching points that need to
be made to help players deal effectively with
zonal defenses, to break through the defenses.
Here are some of the points:

- Seek to place players and play balls into “the
    seams” in the zone.
- Teams must seek to play quickly, using first-
    time touches on the ball to move it and the
    attacking players faster than the zone can
    shift, creating opportunities for penetration.
- The third point builds somewhat on the second.
    Long, accurate passes are required to bypass
    zonal defenses, helping change the point of
    attack.
- Teams should try to play into the center of the
    zone, then back out to the flanks (similar to the
    “inside-outside” approach in basketball).
- The best means of breaking a zone is to be ready
    to counterattack when winning the ball. This
    disrupts the organization of a zonal defense.

8v6 training exercise

- Diagram # 1

The first segment of the training is focused on an
8v6 attacking scheme from the back. An opposing
player hit a long ball to the attacking team’s
goalkeeper to begin the session.

The objective was for the eight attacking players
to enter the ball from the back to a midfielder
who had found a seam in the midfield line of the
zone as the ball traveled across the back line. As

the entry pass is made, the attacking team must
support the ball very quickly as the zone quickly
surrounds the ball. If played to, the supporting
player must be ready to make a decision with the
ball on the first touch.

Diagram # 1 shows a quick ball out of the middle
to the weak side midfielder, subsequently allowing
that player to send a diagonal ball to the weak
side striker. Again, the objective is for the attacking
team to move across the line with the ball; under
control. In the exercise, the defensive team won the
ball, it was limited to three passes before it had to
shoot on goal.

11v11 training exercise

Parsons began the next segment by establishing
two 11-player sides, one playing a 4-4-2 and the
other a 4-3-3 system of play. He placed the 4-3-3
on the field and instructed the players to play
high (establishing their last line of defense at the
midfield line).

_Attacking Zonal Defenses_

_Techniques  Tactics 17 7_

He then placed the attacking team (triangles) on
the field and started play with a long ball from the
opposition to the goalkeeper of the attacking team,
who then distributed it to one of the outside backs.
As the ball traveled from the keeper to the back,
the three defensive midfielders would shift to cover
their zones (Diagram # 2).

Parsons reminded the candidates that the job of
the zonal players was to squeeze space (generally
the three midfielders in a 4-3-3 might be spread
about 12 to 15 yards from each other) and shut off
passing lanes. These tactics can be countered by
quick shifts of the ball by the offensive team’s back
four and by playing accurate passes to teammates
in the seams of the zone (Diagram # 2). Building
out of the back, the attacking team decides which
option is “on” – playing around/over the zone or
between its seams.

Diagram # 2 shows that the right back finds the
extra midfielder (remember the attacking team
has four midfielders versus the other team’s three)
on the perimeter of the field. In turn, that player
elects to play a long cross-field pass to his opposite
outside back who runs into an unoccupied space
before the zone can reorganize (Diagram # 2).

Parsons reminded the coaches that two passes to
send the ball to the weak side of the zone will not

get it done. The ability to play a long, accurate pass
is crucial to effectively penetrate zonal defenses.
Without that technical ability, particularly in your
outside backs and midfielders, you are limited in
your potential to disrupt zonal defenses.

Once the defensive team won the ball, it had only
three passes to attempt a counterattack on goal.
This restriction helped create more opportunities
for the attacking team and, at the same time,
opened up the potential for quick counters should
the attacking team win the ball as the defending
team came forward.

Parsons then told the attacking team that he
wanted them to move the ball quickly, find the
seams and dribble over a line established at the
center circle’s extreme edge.

On more than one occasion during the coaching
session, play was halted to point out that just one
extra touch on the ball by the attacking team had
stalled the opportunity to play a penetrating pass
into a midfielder who had arrived at a position in
a zonal seam. “Play no more than two touches, one
touch if possible” was Parsons’ reminder.

The next phase of the session had the defending
team drop back even farther into a low-pressure
defensive mode, farther compacting its collective
defending.

Parsons explained that the objective at this point
was for the attacking team to find midfielders in
the seams. They then play it back with one touch
to a supporting back, looking to play diagonal balls
over the top of the defense. This “up-back-through”
sequence is shown in Diagram # 3. As noted,
quick decision-making with the ball is essential for
breaking down a zone At times, the players were
able to demonstrate this penetration of midfield
and the quick switch of play. If such a tactic broke
down, it usually was a technical problem (the back
took a second touch on the ball and defensive
pressure would result, which would not allow the

2


_17 8 The Best of Soccer Journal_

change of the point of attack to take place). The
dictum, “There are no tactics without technique,”
raised its ugly soccer head.

The final phase of the 4-4-2 v. 4-3-3 involved an
“in-back-through” sequence trying to be imparted
to the game by the attacking team (depicted in
Diagram # 4). When the ball is played into the
midfield, the defense tends to collapse toward the
ball.

This is when the ball needs to be played back
from the midfield to a supporting back, who then
catches the collective defense moving forward and
plays a ball over the top of the defense to an
on-running striker.

Concluding phase

In the concluding 11v11, Parsons had both teams
playing a 4-4-2 formation and the defending team
(the Os) having only five passes before it had to
shoot on goal.

During this final phase of the training session,
Parsons reminded the candidates of the roles
played by the three lines.

We have seen the back four be responsible for
moving the ball from side to side. What also
is available is penetration via the dribble. As
the zone collects around the ball, the back now
plays away to a teammate in a good supporting
position. Finally, the value of the back’s ability to
play long, penetrating, accurate passes cannot be
overestimated.

Midfielders must find seams in the zone in order
to achieve penetration by their teammates. They
also must be quick to support each other and,
once in control, make quick decisions on how to
play to their front runners or to the space behind
the defense. Strikers also must show into the
seams of the zone, be alert to the potential for
counterattacks into the space behind the defense
(as the zone is being established by the defensive
team) and, as the ball is being passed across the
field, be first to support weak side players.

As the 11v11 game unfolded, Parsons was looking
for the teams to incorporate those ideas into
the practice. One reminder to the teams was for
them to play their outside midfielders as high as
they could defensively. All the coaching points
Parsons made were reiterated during the full-sided
game. One important reminder is that the job
of the attacking team is to put questions in the
minds of the defenders. Make them make decisions.
Put a question in their minds as to defending
responsibilities. Hesitations in this regard will allow
for more successful attacking soccer.

_Attacking the Sweeper_

## Attacking the Sweeper

Striker teamwork is critical to penetrating to the goal

John Bluem

_The following is an overview of a coaching session in
the NSCAA Premier Course at the NSCAA National
Academy held at Nova Southeastern University in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida._

Preparation for session

- Ten training vests are needed for each of the
    two full teams; a different color vest is needed
    for the coach and the two goalkeepers.
- Eight corner flags are used to establish goals in each
    of the four quadrants of the 18-yard line extended.
- Two full-size goals also are required
- A half dozen balls at each end line.

Four-goal game

- Two full squads are selected with one team as
    the attacking team for coaching purposes.
- Play starts with a back from the defending
    team playing a ball to one of the backs of the
    attacking team.
- Each team’s objective is to cross one of its two
    goals with the ball under control.
- The defending team, upon winning the ball,
    must cross the goal line within three passes.
    This assures direct play and assumes that
    the attacking team will have the majority of
    chances to successfully attack the sweeper.

The two strikers are to play in close support of each
other. One would try to check back for the ball and,
if possible, turn with the ball. This would attract the
sweeper as the marking back’s cover. We see this
central combination at work in Diagram # 1.

The striker now can turn or lay off a ball to a
central midfielder, who can dribble or pass to the
second striker, who then is in a good position
to play the ball wide to an outside midfielder to
control the ball and score.

_180 The Best of Soccer Journal_

A second variation of the four-goal game is shown
in Diagram # 2. Here, we see the forward checking
back to the ball being served by an attacking
outside midfielder. Again, the marking back drags
the sweeper with the play. The forward lays the ball
back to a supporting midfielder, who now changes
the field with a ball to the weak side outside
midfielder to go to goal.

11v11

Having stressed central combination play and quick
changes of the point of the attack, goalkeepers
were added to both teams. Now both teams are
playing 11v11, though the attacking team plays
its back four flat so that the inside backs can cover
both of their outside backs. The team defending
now plays with the restriction that it is limited to
four passes in order to develop a shot on goal. This
makes its play very direct.

When trying to create 2v1’s or to isolate your
attacker 1v1 without sweeper cover, teams must
be very patient. If the attempt to create either
of these situations breaks down, teams must, in
collective fashion, play for possession and work the
ball around to achieve either of the two playing
objectives.

A third variation in attack is shown in Diagram
3, where we see the two strikers both checking

to the ball as it is passed between the two
central midfielders. At the same time, the weak
side outside midfielder drags the defender into
the center and the outside back now runs into the
vacated space to receive a pass from the midfielder.
The sweeper has been occupied and drawn away
from the space on the far side of the field.

It is up to the central midfielders to be concerned
with changing the point of attack. It is the outside
midfielders who will occupy the attacking spaces
on the perimeters, and the two strikers should not
make runs into those spaces. Rather, they should

play centrally and seek to occupy the sweeper with
runs as indicated in the Diagram #s.

The coaching position taken by the instructor (who
wore a colored bib that distinguished him from the
two teams) in the 11v11 game was in the middle
of the field. This enabled him to be able to quickly
halt play to point out how certain situations were
effective or not in occupying the sweeper.

## Beating a Packed Defense

Shooting from distance and attacking wide spaces work best

Sigi Schmid

W

henever a soccer team has a fair amount
of success, it will soon confront a unique
problem. The opponents will play a more defensive
game in order to give themselves a better chance
of defeating you. This occurs at the youth, college,
senior, professional, and internationals levels of
play. The question becomes how to still defeat this
opponent who is playing with a “packed defense.”

Patience is a vital element in defeating a defensive-
oriented team. However, patience is usually a
partner of maturity. At the youth and college levels,
maturity and patience are hard to find due to the
inexperience and age of players. As a result, more
upsets occur at these levels.

The key element in defeating any team, and
certainly a defensive team, is to exploit the space
behind the defense. Exploiting this space versus a
defensive team can be accomplished by:

- Counterattacking before the defense gets
    organized.
- Drawing the opponents defense away from
    their goal by shooting from distance and
    maintaining possession (passing), causing the
    opponent’s defense to become impatient and
    come out.
- Attacking wide spaces and getting behind the
    opponent to make crosses

Shooting from distance

Accurate, dangerous shots will force an opponent’s
defense to put pressure on the ball and therefore
move forward. As they do this, openings are
often created for central combinations (one-two’s,

takeovers, double passes, etc.). Shooting from
distance can be part of the training.

Exercise 1(Diagram # 1)
A basic exercise to warm-up is the shooting box
outside the penalty box. Create a grid 30 yards
wide by 20 yards long about 10 yards outside the
penalty box.

Inside this grid, each player has a ball and a number.
When a coach calls out a number, that player (For
example player 3) dribbles out of the grid into the
zone in front of the penalty box and takes a shot.

All the other players continue to dribble and move
within the grid until their number is called. Once a
player shoots, they retrieve the ball and return to
the grid.

Exercise 2 (Diagram # 2)
Here, we slightly alter the format utilized in the
first exercise. When the player’s number is called
(for example player 4), they find space and hit a

1


_182 The Best of Soccer Journal_

one-two pass with the coach who is positioned at
the top of the penalty box, and finish with a shot.

Exercise 3 (Diagram # 3)
Shooting against a packed defense becomes very
realistic when we add defensive bodies into the
drill. A good exercise for this is the long-shooting
game. Use an area that is the size of a double
penalty box in length and the width of a penalty
box. Divide the area in half. In each half, you have
four defenders and two attackers. All players stay
in their half. The defenders maintain possession
in their half looking to free themselves for shots
on goal.

Shots are occurring in the 18-25-yard range
usually. Let’s take the red’s as an example. The red
forwards are looking to defend or re-direct shots
as well as trying to find rebounds. Additionally, a
red defender can play the ball into a red forward
who then plays it back to a red defender for a shot
on goal. Otherwise, the four red defenders try to
interpass the ball looking for open shots. When
the ball turns over, the blue/whites do the same.
The size of the grid and number of players can be
adjusted depending upon the age and ability of
your team. This exercise is realistic and very good
for the development of long-range shooting.

Attacking wide spaces

In order to have successful wide play, your team
must work on the tactics of combination play
in two’s and three’s. The overlap, double-pass,
takeover, and one-two must all be part of their
understanding. Additionally, changing the point
of attack (switching the ball) from one side to the
other and dribbling need to be understood. Here
are two team exercises that can enhance your
team’s ability at creating wide play.

2

4


_Beating a Packed Defense_

_Techniques  Tactics 183_

Exercise 4: Diagram # 4
In a grid the width of the field and a length varying
between 50 and 80 yards, depending upon age
and numbers, create a channel on each side along
the width of the penalty box (Diagram # 4). As the
reds attack, for example, two reds (attackers) are
allowed in the outside channel and only one blue/
white (defender). Thereby, this game always creates
2v1 opportunities on the flanks, enhancing wide
play. When the blue/white team wins the ball, the
same rules apply.

Exercise 5 (Diagram # 5)
In this exercise, the grid is similar in size to the one
above. In each attacking half, two larger cones
are placed about 25 yards from the end line and
20 yards in from each sideline (Diagram # 5). A
team can only conclude an attack on goal by first
playing around the outside of one of the two cones.
This game forces wide play as a means of creating
scoring chances.

Shooting from distance and attacking wide
spaces are two vital means that can make a
difference between successful teams and ones that
“pack it in.”

## Stretching the Opponent

When a team can create gaps and additional space,
good things happen

John Cossaboon

F

ar too much of our soccer (youth, club,
collegiate and, dare I say, “higher levels”)
is being played in a linear fashion. Great things
sometimes occur on the way to the goal, but more
often than not possession is lost. True, the above
is just my opinion; however, it is an aspect of
the game that I spend a lot of time trying to get
players to understand.

I think we would have very little argument among
a group of coaches at their favorite watering hole
related to penetrating (directly) if the space exists.
It makes complete sense. Go forward as fast as
you can if the opponent’s shape is unbalanced
and attacking space exists. I also think that we
would tend to agree with the concept of building
or changing the point of attack if we recognize that
the opponent’s defensive shape is well organized.

Here’s where the argument would start. “We don’t
devote enough time to teaching players to stretch
the opponent.” The concept is simple. Create gaps
and additional space. Attack these newly created
spaces quickly. Keep the opponent unbalanced
by the intelligent movement of the entire team.
Sounds simple.

In order for your players to develop the ability to
stretch (spread) and attack in a cohesive manner,
they must all react immediately, at the instant of
gaining possession. The best teams react before
they possess, but that’s another story.

Initially, let’s keep it simple

- Teach every player to recognize the opponent’s
    shape at the instant your team gains the ball.
       - Teach them to communicate immediately and
          respond to the action of their teammate in
          possession of the ball.
       - Players should ask:
       - Are we attacking at pace because the attacking
          space exists or because we’re caught up in the
          excitement of getting to goal?
       - Are we building when we clearly have an
          opportunity to get into penetrating spaces in a
          more direct manner?

With questions like these, we educate the entire
team and bring them closer to thinking as one.
There always will be situations that create different
responses from different players. That’s fine.
Players’ decisions will begin to move in a similar
direction. They learn to react cohesively if they
are challenged to see the determining factors, the
reasons for the team’s decision to attack directly or
to stretch the opponent.

1


_Stretching the Opponent_

_Techniques  Tactics 185_

The following exercise is one that allows me
to teach and reinforce the concepts I believe
are important to stretching and penetrating an
opponent’s defense.

Exercise I (Diagram # 1)
5v5 (can be varied). Play in a large grid within
one-half of the field. Leave about 10 yards of space
between each boundary line and the half lines

Progression of activity

Initiate activity by playing possession in the large grid.
Players are told to move the ball until one player
can play a ball to a teammate who has expanded
out over any one of the grid’s boundary lines. That
player should receive facing the grid (Diagram # 2).
This pass out initiates “stretching.”

As Player A opens the playing space, teammates
must expand and offer support at either or both
sidelines (based on the ball’s position), as in
Diagram # 3

Initially, defenders could be limited from following
the expanding players, but eventually the players in
possession must learn to distance themselves from
opponents at the instant support is needed. If the
team in possession succeeds with this sequence,

they immediately play back to a teammate within
the grid.

The exercise is continuous and follows the basic
rules of possession. Sequence:

- Possession 5v5.
- Pass out to expanding player.
- Pass to supporting player who has taken up a
    position outside either sideline. Sidelines are
    determined by the boundary that was crossed
    with first pass out.
- Re-enter grid, battle to maintain possession
    (repeat) non-stop. Loss of possession, at any
    time, simply reverses roles (offense to defense).

2

_186 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Exercise II: Diagram # 4
Continue as above with the addition of one more
objective.

Play a third pass down the sideline that has been
exploited.

- Possess
- Expand
- Stretch
- Penetrate flank

This activity continues to be played with any
particular attacking direction. The first pass to
an expanding player determines the flanks. Play
can be continuous or restarted with a “free” pass
back into the grid after each successful sequence.
Reward the successful team.

Exercise III: Diagram # 5

- Use whatever numbers and size grid are
    appropriate to your team.
- Place goals on each 18 (with goalkeepers).
- Center the same grid between these goals. The
    starting place is basically both teams’ middle
    third.
Play starts with both teams battling for possession
in the center grid. The team in possession expands
at will, either back and out or simply out to a flank.
They attack in a predetermined direction. Allow

them to experiment (play!), but make corrections
based on what you see.

- If the keeper makes a save, have him distribute
    to the center grid.
- If a goal is scored or the opponent gains
    possession, the ball must return to the center
    grid (i.e., for at least three passes).

Coaching points, in all stages

- Recognition of the compact defense.
- Communication by and playing to the
    expanding player.
- Early recognition and movement to close and
    far supporting positions.
- Quick, clean touches, body position to
    attacking direction and quality distribution
- Timing and selection of runs.
- Finally, as always, remove restrictions and play
    within the match condition.

In conclusion, we can all directly play the first time
we step on a soccer field. Let’s give players the
information they need to make quality decisions
related to the most appropriate method of attack.
Each attacking movement is enhanced when
players understand the role they play in bringing it
to completion. Goal!

## SWI-I-I-ITCH!

Changing the point of attack creates penetrating spaces
to allow breakthroughs

Robert Parr

W

ell-organized defenses typically place a
large number of players between the ball
and their goal, leaving little space for an attacking
team to create high-quality scoring opportunities.
When faced with this type of defensive
compactness, a team must vary its point of attack
to create penetrating spaces for overlapping and
supporting players away from the ball, breaking
down the opponent’s defensive shape.

Changing the point of attack can be accomplished
directly (a single long service from one side of the
field to the other) or indirectly (several players
combining to quickly pass the ball from one
touchline to the other). The central midfielders
and defenders have the greatest influence over
this element of the game, because they have the
most opportunities to switch the ball from one side
to the other and should be in position to see the
attacking options in front of them.

If the midfielders are struggling to change the
point of attack in game play, consideration should
be given to the following questions to identify the
potential tactical causes of each breakdown:

- Do players recognize when to change the
    point of attack? When the ball is near the
    touchline and both teams have packed the
    space in front of the dribbler, teams should
    look to switch the point of attack to the
    opposite side of the field. The middle third of
    the field is the best area in which to do this
    since teams generally want to drive straight to
    goal in their attacking third and avoid playing
    balls across the center of their defensive third.
       - Are the central players providing close
          support when the wing players have the ball?
          Few players have the physical ability to strike a
          ball across the full width of the field while
          under pressure. Because of this, the central
          players must constantly provide close support
          to the flank players so they can combine to
          move the ball to the far side while still playing
          within their physical limits.
       - Are the wing players (away from the ball)
          using the full width of the field to stretch the
          opposing defense as much as possible? Once
          the central player has received the ball and is
          looking to play it to the opposite side, he/she
          needs to have a teammate in position to receive
          that ball. The receiving winger must start square
          with the ball on the far touchline so he/she can
          receive the cross while running directly toward
          goal. By starting behind the line of the ball and
          as wide as possible, the wing player also will
          maximize the amount of positive attacking space
          the ball can be delivered into.
       - Are the players reading the opponent’s
          defensive organization to serve the ball
          into the correct spaces? If the defenders on
          the far side of the field have taken a deep
          posture, leaving a gap between themselves and
          the wing players, the service from the central
          midfielder should be played directly to the feet
          of the winger and away from the defenders.
          Alternately, if the defense has pushed out of
          the back, the service should be played into the
          open space behind the defensive line and away
          from the opposing goalkeeper.

As with any other aspect of the game, players
may be making the correct decisions, yet they
still give up possession when they try to
move the ball to the other side of the field.
In this situation, consideration should also be
given to some of the technical points of failure
that could be limiting success:

- Are the central players able to turn with
    the ball on their first touch? When a central
    player receives the ball from a teammate on

the wing, he/she needs to quickly adjust his/
her body position to see the other side of the
field. Typically, the receiving player should use
the outside of the foot to “sweep” the ball
toward the middle of the field on the first
touch, “opening” his/her vision to identify all
forward penetrating options.

- Are the central players turning directly into
    defensive pressure? If the supporting player is
    closely marked, he/she should use the outside

_SWI-I-I-ITCH!_

_Techniques  Tactics 189_

of the foot farthest from the defender to sweep
the ball away from pressure, shielding the ball
away from a possible tackle.

- Do the players have the proper power on
    the ball when they strike it over longer
    distances? The pace and placement of longer
    crosses is especially important when a team
    uses a more direct approach to switch the
    point of attack. If the services are hit too hard,
    the team may lose possession out of bounds.
    Worse still, if crosses are falling short, the
    attacking team becomes vulnerable to a quick
    counterattack when the ball is intercepted by
    opposing central defenders.

The following game helps train players to read an
opponent’s defensive shape and encourages them
to change the point of attack in midfield to find
better attacking options.

Midfield Point of Attack Game

Set up a field 30 yards long by 60 yards wide with
three sets of cone goals placed along each end. The
two cone goals in the center of the field should be
only two to three yards wide; the other four goals
(near each corner of the field) should be six to
eight yards wide. Play a game of 6v6, with each
team defending three goals and attacking the
other three goals.

This exercise should provide many opportunities
to evaluate and correct the players’ ability to
provide short supporting options to teammates on
the wings, as well as the timing of their decisions
to switch the point of attack. As the players
begin to find success in this game, increase the
dimensions of the area to play in half a field. The
extra depth should present more opportunities to
adjust between direct and indirect styles, using
the positioning of the defensive line to guide this
decision-making. Finally, remove the small goals
and play to two full-sized goals (with keepers) to

confirm that the players continue to read their
attacking options across the width of the field,
even under game conditions.

## Quick Breaks = Goals!!!

Quick breaks lead to scores — counterattacks can catch
opponents before they recover to strong defensive positions

Wayne Harrison

C

ounterattacking is becoming an important
part of a team’s tactical package. Recent
tactics employed at the international level
underscore the importance of counterattacking.
Teams should use the following progression when
learning the counterattack on the training ground.
The guidelines for each step:

- Time the break to get a shot within 10 seconds.
    Decrease the time as the team improves the
    attack.
- Players work alternately in both directions. This
    is also a good conditioning session. Working
    both ways allows all players to get involved in
    the activity.
- The idea of this session is to practice quick
    breaks (counterattacks) against opponents
    as they recover back into strong defensive
    positions.
- Set the session up based on the number of
    players at the training session.
- Set it up to go only one side if there is little
    space to work in or a small number of players.
    Be flexible.
- Both teams get the chance to practice
    attacking and defending at pace, which will
    improve quick decision-making.
- Introduce offside where and when necessary.
    It may be best not to use offside initially until
    the players get used to the idea. As the session
    moves on, it should be game realistic, with
    offside being used.

Step I: 2v1 in Attack –
The Basic Set-Up

- Players make two passes among themselves
    in midfield, then pass it to the striker. Three
    players (3, 4 and 5) support quickly to exploit
    the attacking overload situation. Recovery runs
    by defenders (B) cannot begin until the ball
    has been passed into the striker.
- Begin with an overload and have two strikers
    against one defender (as above). Have one
    recovering defender to help the sole defender
    already at the back but who is in a 2v1
    disadvantage. This is a good start to the session, as
    it makes it easier to gain success for the attacking
    team, which ultimately is the goal of the drill.

Progression

- A 2v1 up front in favor of the strikers, creating
    a 5v2 overload situation where three support

1


_Quick Breaks = Goals!!!_

_Techniques  Tactics 191_

players and one recovering defender join in as
the ball is played into the two strikers.

- A 1v1 up front, creating a 4v2 overload
    when three support players and a recovering
    defender join the attack.
- A 2v2 up front creates a 5v3 overload with
    three support players and one recovering
    defensive player.
- A 1v2 disadvantage (one striker and two
    defenders) creates a 4v3-overload situation
    with three support players and one recovering
    defensive player.
- With each progression, the attacking situation
    gets more difficult and is a greater challenge
    to the players. The coach should work through
    each progression based on how quickly the
    players have success. The number of support
    players and the number of recovering players
    can be varied; this sequence is suggested as
    a guide. Keep experimenting to find the best
    formula to suit a team’s particular needs.

Step II: 1v1 in Attack

- The next step is a 1v1 situation. This is a
    more difficult attacking situation. The midfield
    player passes to space for (1) to come off the
    defender and turn. Three players break quickly
    to support, with two players running to the

center and one wide. One defender makes a
recovery run to help, creating a 4v2 situation

- Now move on to a 2v2 situation by adding
    another striker and another defender. Then try
    a 1v2 in favor of the defenders – all are good
    progressions for this session. The final setup
    may mean it is difficult for (1) to receive the
    ball if the two defenders screen both sides of
    the forward. The support players can “run the
    ball in” on the dribble to start play.

Step III: 2v2 in Attack

- The graphic below (Diagram #3) shows a
    2v2 attacking situation. This phase begins to
    coordinate the movement of the strikers. Here
    (1) goes short to receive a ball to feet and
    takes (A) with him/her, creating space behind
    for the diagonal run of (2), who goes “late and
    fast” to get away from marker (B). The midfield
    player has more options with this type of
    movement. Timing of the run is important.
- “Late and fast” means that (2) can receive the
    ball in front to go on to shoot at goal having
    escaped (B) marking. If too early, then (2) may
    receive the ball with his/her back to goal and
    (B) will have time to cover. The early run will
    mean the forward (2) will have to link with
    another attacking player.

_192 The Best of Soccer Journal_

Step IV: 1v2 in Attack

- The coach can vary the direction the defenders
    recover from to make the situation more
    difficult for the attacking team. Here, defenders
    are recovering from both sides of the field.
    Attacking players also are breaking forward
    from both sides, (2) from the center and (5)
    from the opposite side.
- The coach can vary the numbers of attacking
    and defending players at any time to ensure
    success.
- Attacking from all sides of the field creates a
    bigger challenge to all the attacking players.
    A 5v4 is created here, but the situation can
    be set up to focus on any aspect of the
    counterattack. Using the set-up above, a 5v4
    is created one way and a 3v2 is created going
    the other way, unless the players are permitted
    to recover back from the previous quick break
    encounter.
- The secret is to vary the numbers attacking
    each way depending on the situations the
    coach is trying to create – big overloads, small
    overloads, degree of difficulty, etc., change
    the situation for the players. Only the coach’s
    imagination limits the variables in this session.

Step V: 1v2 in Attack

- This is another example of a 1v2 disadvantage.
    Depending on numbers playing in the training
    session, the coach may, in this situation,
    have only one recovering defender and three
    attacking players joining the lone striker,
    creating a 4v3 situation. This means there are
    players left to play in the other direction once
    the first attack is finished.

Directional session

- The session is set up to favor attacking play,
    hence the overload attacking is always in the
    attacking team’s favor, therefore this leaves an
    overload in the middle.
- The team in possession can make up to
    three passes, then must pass the ball to the
    strikers. Three midfield players break quickly
    to support (making a 5v1 overload in favor of
    the attacking team). Start with a big overload
    and a 2v1 in favor of the strikers in attack, as
    in Part 1, and then introduce the recovering
    midfielder later when the session is working
    well for a greater challenge. This leaves a 4v1
    situation in favor of the defending team in the
    middle zone if no recovering midfielder is used

(^4) to begin. If the defenders win the ball or the
5


_Quick Breaks = Goals!!!_

_Techniques  Tactics 193_

keeper receives it, the ball is played quickly
into the middle zone (to a 4v1 overload again,
going the other way). They can make up to
three passes, then get the ball to the striker to
attack in the other direction. Players can pass
or run the ball in based on each situation. Vary
the difficulty depending on how successful
the team is, constantly giving them greater
challenges.

- It may take three passes or only one. Have the
    players try to make three passes or less if the
    ball is not overplayed in the middle. Have extra
    balls available to keep the session flowing. If
    one team scores or the ball goes out of play,
    pass a ball to the other team to restart from
    midfield, otherwise the defenders will win it
    and pass it into the middle zone to attack the
    other way.
- Introduce offside when it is necessary. Do not
    use it until the players are ready, then make the
    situation realistic.

Potential progressions

- 2v1 up front in favor of the strikers with three
    supporting players, making a 5v1 situation.
- 1v1 up front with three supporting players,
    making a 4v1 situation.
- 1v1 up front with three supporting players and
    1 recovering player, making a 4v2 situation.
- 2v2 up front with two supporting players,
    making a 4v2.
- 1v2 up front with two supporting players,
    making a 4v2.

2v1 in Attack (Diagram # 6)

The first part of the session is the easiest to gain
success with: a 2v1 advantage up front and three
supporting players breaking forward to help the
two strikers, creating the 5v1 overload. Coaching
points include:

- Look for quick breaks in attack.
- Passing and support play.
- Early shots on goal.
    - Regains of the ball and quick counterattacks
       going the other way.

2v1 in Attack (Diagram # 7)

- After the ball has been passed to No. 2, the
    three supporting players break forward into
    various positions, offering up several choices
    for passing. This should progress easily into a
    cross and a shot or header on goal. In many
    cases, the coach can move on from this set-up
    quickly into something more challenging.

_194 The Best of Soccer Journal_

1v1 in Attack (Diagram # 8)

- Now there is a 1v1 up front. In this example,
    we have the three supporting players joining
    the lone striker, making it a 4v1 overload in
    favor of the attacking team.
- Timing of the support runs is important
    (stagger support so they do not all go in a
    straight line), as are the areas covered in
    support so there are many options for the
    player on the ball to choose from.

2v2 in Attack (Diagram # 9)

- Now we have a 2v2 in attack. An example of
    an attack here is for the striker to go short to
    receive to feet, half turn and play the ball wide
    for an attacking midfielder who breaks forward
    and gets a cross into the box. Now, it is the
    secondary movement of the strikers to get into
    the box once the first link up that we need to
    focus on has been made. Players attacking all
    the important areas in and around the box,
    near post, middle of the goal and far post, all
    done as quickly as possible against the clock
    emphasizing speed in attack
- No. 2 near post, No. 1 far post, and midfielder
    No. 4 in the middle around or just inside the
    edge of the box.

2v2 in Attack (Diagram # 10)

- Finishing positions of the players are near post,
    far post and central behind. The defenders also
    are back, as this set-up is offside.
- The cross is into the second six-yard box away
    from the keeper. Recovering defenders must
    avoid scoring an own goal in this situation.
- This is an example of why it is good to deliver
    the cross quickly behind the defenders and not
    take it to the by line to cross, which allows the
    opponents to recover defensive position.
- Work on the timing and angle of the runs into
    the box and contact on the ball to finish with a
    goal attempt.

_Quick Breaks = Goals!!!_

_Techniques  Tactics 195_

1v2 in Attack (Diagram # 11)

- Staying with the overload theme, it is now a
    more difficult 1v2 situation up front. It is a 3v2
    overload with two instead of three midfielders
    joining in to attack. Players can run or pass the
    ball in. No. 1 needs to get free to receive. This is
    a real test now with just the 3v2 overload.
- To make it even more difficult, have a recovering
    defender get back to help out the defense.
- The counterattack is now slightly more difficult
    also with a 4v2 overload in the middle midfield
    zone going the other way and only a 3v2
    overload if the recovering defender has been
    added.

Further Progression (Diagram # 12)

- Player E shoots at goal. The keeper gains
    possession of the ball. Introduce a development
    where a midfield player can “drop deep to
    receive the ball,” either from the keeper or a
    defender to set up the next play.
- No. 1 drops off and receives the ball to work it
    forward through midfield or directly to a striker,
    in this case a pass to No. 4, who runs the ball
    into the attacking zone to create a 4v2 with
    No. 3 moving in from midfield.
- The team has transitioned very quickly from the
    keeper to the strikers after gaining possession.

More Direct Play (Diagram # 13)

- Choices now include quick counterattacking
    playing through the midfield or a direct ball
    into the strikers, and the midfield can then link
    up with them.
- No. 6 plays a long ball into the feet of striker
    No. 1. Nos. 3 and 4 are already on the way
    forward to support the strikers from midfield.
- The move shows these players breaking forward
    to attack on the numbers team, creating a 4v2
    overload and the defending team’s midfield
    who attacked the other way previously (Players
    D and E) are recovering to be ready for the next

11

12

13


_196 The Best of Soccer Journal_

attack the other way. They must be available
to receive the ball should Players K, A or B win
possession. Another transition attack then is

underway in the opposite direction.

- Progression: A recovering defender who comes
    out of the middle midfield zone to help the
    defenders can be added to both sides.
- Work on defending against a counterattacking
    fast break overload too, but that is another
    session altogether.

Planning for Part Two

Attacking Team

- Midfielders must get the passes in, then break
    quickly and support the strikers as the ball
    is played into them. Midfielders can run or
    pass the ball in and another player can go in.
    Vary the support players from here based on
    available space.
- Strikers must get free from their markers to
    receive the ball and link up with the attacking
    quick break midfielders or turn and attack
    themselves — depending on the defenders’
    positions.
- The team needs to score in a certain short
    time scale. Decrease the time allowed as they
    improve at this.
- Vary the number of players in striking positions
    as you develop the session. Start with one, then
    two. Have these two link together to develop
    an understanding of movement off the ball for
    each other to create space for themselves and
    each other.
- As soon as the move breaks down, the
    attacking midfield players who joined in with
    the strikers need to get back to their original
    midfield area. You also can coach them to
    rotate – it may be a striker who is nearer who
    makes a recovery run back to fill in for the
    midfielder who may have ended up beyond
    that striker in the attacking third of the field.
    Nearest player, shortest recovery route back.
- The idea is to overload the attack to gain
    success from the session in an attacking sense,
    but at the same time keep balance should the
    opponents win the ball and attack quickly the
    other way.

_Quick Breaks = Goals!!!_

_Techniques  Tactics 197_

Defending Team

- Recovering players get back quickly to counter
    the quick attack.
- Vary the number of defenders already in
    position and those recovering during build-up
    of the session to change the challenges of the
    teams.
- Midfielders in the middle third on the team
    without the ball must be ready to break quickly
    should they win it back in the defending third.
    They need to be moving constantly, getting
    free from opponents to receive the ball once
    the keeper or a defender gains possession of it.
- The strikers on the team without the ball also
    need to be constantly moving. Don’t stand
    still – keep working the defenders so that they
    are ready and in a position of advantage when
    their team wins possession.
- When the defending team wins the ball and
    it is played into midfield, it may be a defender
    who joins in and goes all the way into the
    attacking third. The defender can pass or run
    it in. Make sure a midfielder drops back into a
    defensive position into the defensive third to
    provide cover. This encourages the players to
    rotate positions and develop more freedom in
    their positioning on the field.

General Observations

- Once the session gets going, maintain the
    overload situations in midfield as the
    transitions take place from defense to attack to
    ensure you get the session working effectively.
    There should be constant transition from
    attack to defense and defense to attack, both
    happening at pace.
- Eventually open the game up into an actual
    scrimmage and see if both teams have adopted
    the quick break mentality you have been trying
    to teach. Now it is equal numbers in all areas,
    so it will be a good test for the players to see if
    they can make it work.

Revisions of Developments for the
Transition Game

- 2v1 in each attacking and defending zone
    and 4v4 in the middle zone to begin. Big
    overload to gain success in the attacking play,
    three attacking midfielders and one recovering
    defender making a 4v2 overload.
- 1v1 in each attacking and defending zone and
    5v5 in the middle zone.
- 2v2, then 1v2 in the attacking and defending
    zones with fewer players in the middle zone but
    still equal numbers there. Midfield can run it in
    now. Work on the movement of the two strikers
    or the lone striker to create space and move the
    defenders around.
- Allow a midfield player from the middle zone
    to drop back into the defending zone where
    his or her team has regained possession to
    provide help in the link-up play (distances may
    prevent a good long pass from the back directly
    to midfield, depending on the age group being
    coached, so this helps). Opponents can’t follow
    them in (put a restriction on this) to give the
    attack a better chance to build quickly.
- Encourage different units of players to
    interchange based on where they end up in
    a positional sense on the field of play –
    for example, if a defender breaks forward
    and ends up in the attacking third, have a
    midfielder drop back to cover; if a midfielder
    moves into the attacking third in the most
    advanced position on that team and the team
    then loses possession, maybe a striker can drop
    back to cover.
- This allows and supports freedom of movement
    for the players. They can have confidence to
    interchange on the field, knowing a teammate
    will cover for them.

## High Pressure vs. Low Pressure

Jay Miller

The following was originally published in the July-
August 1984 Soccer Journal. Jay Miller made this
presentation at the 1984 NSCAA Convention in
Philadelphia.

H

igh pressure can best be used in the
following situations:

- To catch opponents off guard, especially at the
    beginning of a match
- When opponents are weak defensively or when
    the defenders have trouble getting the ball out
    of their defensive third
- When a team is behind or tied and needs a
    goal late in the match
- To change the tempo of the game

On the other hand, low pressure may be
employed when:

- When a team is much slower than the opponents
- When there are opposing players that demand
    special attention and can not be contained by
    a team’s regular defensive tactics, i.e., 1 on 1
    marking
- Injuries prevent a team from playing as it
    usually would
- A team is fatigued and just wants to “hold on”
    to preserve a win or a draw
- When a team’s most effective attacking
    weapon is the counterattack. A low pressure
    defense can open up space behind opponents
    as they come forward.
- A team is playing numbers down after losing a
    man to a red card

High Pressure

Generally, high pressure defense is man to man
and should be applied in the opponent‘s defensive
third – your attacking third – of the field. It is

most effective when alternated with other styles
of defensive play. Because high pressure requires
100% intensity, it is hard to apply constantly
throughout the entire match.

The best time to introduce high pressure would
be a dead ball situation, such as a throw-in,
or with a substitution of a fresh player. It is
important that the coach know his/her personnel
and give pressurizing responsibilities to the type of
individuals whose playing style and personalities
fit the role.

A variation on the standard high pressure man
to man would be some form of zone press all
over the field. Because high pressure leaves a
team vulnerable at the back, it is important that
the coach makes his/her team aware of this by
training the team to maintain balance and to be
prepared for defensive adjustments in the back.

The goalkeeper, in particular, needs specialized
training in the type of situations that he/she will
face when his team is playing high pressure. The
keeper must practice breakaway saves, as well as
directing the team from the top of the 18-yard
box or even becoming a “sweeper” if necessary. If
any player is beaten in high pressure marking, he/
she should know the proper lines of recovery to
get back and goal side to prevent penetration by
opponents as quickly as possible.

Low Pressure

Low pressure, on the other hand, offers a
considerable contrast. The most vital element in
low pressure defense is organization. Each player
must be aware of the specific responsibilities of
the position and know how to fall back to protect


_High Pressure vs. Low Pressure_

_Techniques  Tactics 199_

the critical area in the defensive third of the
field. However, once the team has retreated,
there are important considerations. There is no
longer the luxury of loose marking, nor can a
defender afford to pass an attacking player in the
defensive third.

A danger in employing low pressure, whether in
a zone or man to man, is that the defenders
retreat too far and crowd the goalkeeper. This
prevents the keeper from seeing the play clearly
and reducing the room to maneuver or come out of
the goal area.

Since a common tactic employed to upset a zone
or defeat any type of low pressure defense is to
switch play, the goalkeeper must receive training
on dealing with air balls flighted into the box.

Finally, the coach should not only develop the
organization of the defense but should educate
the team in the principles of the counterattack
to take advantage of opportunities created in
quick transition.

Summary

Regardless of which style the team plays, it is
the responsibility of the coach to prepare his
squad. In training sessions, the coach must create
situations that could appear in competitive
matches and rehearse these until the players
become accustomed to the system. By intelligent
use of personnel in the right positions and by
preparing each player thoroughly, the coach can
enhance the possibilities for success.

## Zonal Defending

Is it right for your team?

Jeff Tipping

T

his presentation deals with methods of
teaching zonal defending. We are primarily
concerned here with two major characteristics of
zonal defending:

- Concern with space defending rather than man-
    to-man. The decision whether to mark a man
    tightly or to cover a teammate is highlighted in
    zonal defending more than man-to-man.
- Maintaining an effective team shape from
    which to defend. Collective defending is more
    important in zonal systems. Keeping zone small
    and tight is critical if this system is to be effective.

It should be noted that most zonal teams play
out of a 4-4-2 formation. It is generally accepted
that four players can cover the dangerous spaces
across the field. Most international teams play a
zone defense.

Coaches adopt zonal tactics for a number of
reasons, some of which include:

- Team shape. It is easier to keep a good defending
    shape out of a zone. Players are less inclined to get
    pulled out of important positions.
- Fitness. Players in zones generally do less
    running and tacking of opponents around the
    field.
- Weaknesses. It is easier to hide a weak
    defender in a zone than in man-to-man.
- Attack. Teams that have maintained a good
    shape defensively can attack more efficiently
    from an organized shape after gaining possession.

The disadvantages in zonal defending may include:

- Assignment marking. It is difficult to pull
    a player out of a zone to “assign mark” an
    outstanding opponent.
       - Demands verbal communication. “When in
          doubt, give a shout” is never more true than in
          zonal defending. Talking is indispensable and
          yet many of our players do not talk.
       - Square back four. The back four get caught
          flat, especially when the ball is in the middle of
          the field, or with long flighted balls.
       - Decision-making. Emphasizes the burden on
          defenders of deciding whether to pressure a
          player or cover for a teammate. This leads to
          looser marking than in man-to-man. (Ian Rush
          vs. Everton 1989 FA Cup Final goals #2 and #3)

Keys to good zonal defending

- The work of the two central defenders is vital.
    The whole team pivots around these two.
- Defenders generally do not cross in front of
    each other except in emergency situations.
    They may cross behind a teammate to cover for
    him or to cut out a through pass.
- Teams must be compact and “travel with the
    ball.” Defenders must move as a block to
    minimize spaces.
- The ball should be forced wide and kept wide.
    This helps the “stepping” effect of back four
    and midfield.
- There must be constant pressure on the ball to
    prevent vertical service.
- If there is not pressure on the ball, the two
    central defenders must decide whether to drop
    off or possibly step up to catch opponents
    offside.

_Techniques  Tactics 201_

Warm-ups

Handball – Game normally promotes lots
of verbal communication between players
(Diagram # 1)

5v5 in each half of the field. One defender goes
in goal when opponents come over halfway line.
Defense plays a 4v5. Nobody allowed over halfway
line, but when defense wins ball, they play pass to
teammates in other half. Passing is by the hand
only. Player in possession is allowed two steps
before passing. Goals only scored on header.

“Fire” exercise (Diagram # 2)

This exercise (designed by coach Mike Berticelli of
Notre Dame) is a good exercise for team morale and
also teaching defenders important zonal principles.
Split team into three groups of three defenders
and two groups of seven attackers. Three defenders
stand in the “D”. Goalkeeper punts the ball to
seven attackers waiting at the halfway line. As GK
punts the ball, the two outside defenders sprint
to opposite touchlines, and the central defender
runs around the goal. The attackers must wait for a
teammate to touch the ball before they can go over
the halfway line and attack. All three defenders

must sprint to get back into a defensive triangle to
deal with the oncoming seven attackers. Alternate
groups and keep score. If defenders intercept the
ball and play it out of bounds, they get a goal;
attackers get a goal if they score.

Teaching zonal coverage

- Training the two center backs.
    The pivoting of the center backs is a good place
    to start when introducing zonal defending.
    Each center back must decide when to pressure
    and when to drop off and cover.

Organization (Diagram # 3)

- Two center backs vs. one center forward in
    central half of one field. The center backs
    are responsible for one goal each. When they
    win the ball, they play ball to side servers or
    straight to their center forward.
- Center forward can score in either goal.
- Introduce second center forward.

Coaching Points

- Two center backs must be concerned with their zone.
- Verbal communication with each other,
    especially when switching.
- Tactical decision-making as to who shall
    pressure or who shall cover.

_202 The Best of Soccer Journal_

- Center backs should not cross in front of each
    other – “pass on” the attackers to each other.

It is important to introduce a second center forward,
as center backs in a zonal system frequently play
2v2. Communication is even more important as
the covering and pressuring decisions become more
complex with the second striker to deal with.

Organization (Diagram # 4A and 4B)

- Play four goals, two in each half of central
    field area with teams allowed to play directly
    to their center forwards or play to server who
    then dictates passes. Each back is assigned a
    goal to defend.

Introduction of outside backs

Organization (Diagram # 5A and 5B)

- Two outside backs who also must defend a goal
    are introduced. The back four now must each
    defend a goal while still covering for each other.
- Support players are placed at corners of the
    halfway line to help the two center forwards.
- Goals should be at least four yards wide to
    prevent defenders from retreating into goals
    and not pressuring.
- Nobody allowed over halfway line.
- Defenders play balls into other half once ball is
    won, or to side support players.
- Build up to 4v4v4v4.

Coaching Points

- Defender must decide when to tackle/pressure
    and when to drop off/cover.
- Outside backs pinch in to help center backs
    when ball is central (5A).
- Try to force ball outside.
- Defenders step in themselves when ball is in
    wide position (5B).

Traveling with the ball
These exercises were used by former Scotland
coach Andy Roxburgh and are designed to help the
defenders keep their zonaL-shape laterally across
the field and also establish compactness vertically
up and down the field.

Organization (Diagram # 6)

- On a full field, the trainer (T) has a ball and is
    alone with the back four. Trainer establishes an
    acceptable distance between him and the back
    four (25-30 yards) and puts markers down
    every 25-30 yards downfield. Trainer moves
    with the ball, and back four maintain that
    distance between themselves and trainer up to
    halfway line.
- Flank players placed and pinned at four wide
    positions. When ball played to players in wide
    position, the back four must swivel.
- Two attacking center forwards are introduced.
    Four defensive midfielders are introduced.
       - Midfield players must do the same as back
          four and travel with the ball, no more than
          five yards away. When ball is played to wide
          players, the whole team must swivel.
       - Wide players can play ball into center forwards
          and then the game is live.
       - Add more numbers to make it more like a
          game. Central midfielders replace trainer.

Coaching Points

- Keep correct spacing between ball and the two
    “lines” of defenders.
- When ball is played to a wide attacker, both
    lines must swivel and employ “stepping” in
    their positioning.
- Angles of approach are such that attackers are
    forced down the touchline.
- Midfielders try to screen opposing center
    forwards by “stepping” into passing lanes,
    especially when ball is in wide position.
- Midfielders try to push up on opposing outside
    backs when those backs are retreating to
    retrieve a ball. Center backs must push the
    whole team forward.

Stepping – and the offside factor

The stepping effect of the back four and midfield
enables covering defenders to:

5B 6


_204 The Best of Soccer Journal_

- Slide behind a beaten defender (e.g., triangle
    #11 is beaten by attacker #2, T#6 can slide
    behind to contain attacker).
- Be well positioned to cut out balls to the feet
    of the center forward (e.g., T#6 may be able to
    cut out a pass to attacking #9).
- Pick off a pass played over the heads of
    pressuring or second defenders (e.g., a ball
    floated over T#4 can be attacked by T#2).
- Positioned to be able to see ball and detect a
    vertical or diagonal run by attacker (e.g., T#4
    can track a run by attacking #10 and still see
    flight of the ball).

A critical point that a trainer must now wrestle with
is the positioning of defenders relative to attacking
players and offside space. Teams with high-pressure
opponents must be pushed up from the rear to
maintain compactness; therefore, space behind the
back four could be exploited by attackers making
vertical/diagonal runs. The decision for the back
four, especially, is whether to track these runs or
hold their position in the hope that players will run
into offside positions.

Baressi, the Italian defender, is the supreme
example of a defender who uses the offside line

7 8

9 10


_Zonal Defending_

_Techniques  Tactics 205_

by stepping up or dropping off as the ball is about
to be struck. In Diagram # 8, Red #2 and #4 have
flattened their “stepped” position. This positioning
makes attackers #9 and #10 much more reluctant
to make a vertical run as they are not being
kept onside by #2 as they are in Diagram # 7.
However, if attacking #10 beats the offside line,
the defending team is in a very poor position to
recover. The other benefit to an offside line is the
run of attackers #6 or #8 from a deep position.

Steve McMahon, formerly of Liverpool, was a master
of beating the offside trap from a deep position.
When holding an offside line, some consideration
must be given to the following.

- Players making runs from deep positions are
    liable to beat the offside line.
- Players coming from weak-side blind positions
    are liable to beat the line.
- Generally, the shorter the distance of the pass
    the more an official’s judgment is burdened.
- Runs from inside to out are easier to recover
    from (Diagram # 9) than outside in, or straight
    vertical runs (Diagram # 10). The angle of the

run is of considerable importance if the runner
beats the offside line.

The decision as to whether to hold an offside
line or track a vertical run is a split second one.
It demands not only good judgment but also
perfect coordination between teammates. A well-
orchestrated offside line, while annoying to the
spectator, can keep opponents squeezed into very
small places and is a very useful, if somewhat
dangerous, tactic. The question of who shall adopt
a zonal system is of particular interest to those
coaches who wrestle with the concept of which
system is preferable for them. Those choices do
depend on the qualities of the players available to
a coach, yet both systems have inherent strengths
and weaknesses, which were highlighted for all to
see in World Cup ’94.

## To Sweep or Not to Sweep...

Defense may involve three-, four- or five-player alignments

Mike Jacobs

W

hen examining the shape of how your
opponent will play, one means of
determining their system of play is to note how
they are aligned at the back.

The two things you usually look at first are: How
many players are they using at the back and are they
playing with a sweeper or are they flat? Further, I
think not only about how our opponents are playing
at the back but why they are playing that way.

Three at the back

Depending on whether you consider the Italian
3-5-2 a five-man defensive alignment, most teams
defend with either three or four at the back. I have
found success using both alignments in the past

- as well as some failures.

The first time I was really exposed to playing with
three at the back was working with the FC Westchester
’77s and coach Al Pastore in the early ’90s. The key to
playing in that kind of alignment is having three
players at the back who are very athletic. Since
we played with a sweeper who covered the ground
behind two man-markers, the key player was Jeff Bilyk
(who currently plays for the Miami Fusion). He was
an excellent athlete, strong technically and tactically.
He did an excellent job covering his teammates when
balls were played in behind them.

When you play with two man-markers and a deep-
lying sweeper behind them, you can open yourself
up to having the shape of your back three pulled
all over the place by the opposition’s attacking
players (Diagram # 1).

When that happens, there is little or no cover
behind your wide midfielders. We were blessed to
have an athlete like Jeff, who read the game well
and had the ability to close down wide spaces.
When Jerry Yeagley’s Indiana University team won
back-to-back national championships in 1998 and
1999, he played in a similar alignment. He also
was blessed with one of the best athletes in the
country in sweeper Nick Garcia.

Flat back three

At Iona College, we played with three at the back
using a zonal defensive scheme. The personnel was
a little different than the FC Westchester team,
and we believed we would be better served playing
with three backs playing close together (15 yards
apart), passing on the opponent’s two forwards.
This allowed us to continue to put pressure on the
man with the ball, as well as provide cover and
balance for that defender. By having three players

1


_To Sweep or Not to Sweep..._

_Techniques  Tactics 207_

sharing defensive responsibilities across the width
of our defense third, we rarely got too strung out.
With two midfielders acting as a double-screen in
front of our back three, we were very compact and
organized defensively (Diagram # 2).

Playing in that kind of formation allowed our
players, when pressurizing the ball, to have cover.
And we knew that the cover and balance we were
able to establish between our back three, the
two wide players, and central midfielders allowed
us to be compact enough that we would not be
easily beaten.

The toughest team I had to coach against at this
level was Ray Reid’s University of Connecticut
team, and it was no surprise to see them win
the NCAA title in 2000. He had one of the best
defenses in the country, and when you have a field
general like Chris Gbandi calling the shots in the
middle of the back with a ball-winner like Mansour
Ndjaye in front of him, getting behind their defense
is like breaking into Fort Knox.

Four give you more coverage

While teams are able to find success playing with
three at the back, this system has its limitations
as well. If you are going to play with a sweeper in

that kind of alignment, that player had better be a
tremendous athlete who can cover a lot of ground
because he will be left alone quite a bit back
there. To play with a flat three at the back, you
will need to be very organized, as well as have two
workmanlike and athletic wide players who can
come in and play as left and right back at times
surrounding the three center backs.

The reason most teams play with four at the back
is that it allows them more cover for their man-
markers as well as their wide midfielders. It also
allows good defensive balance across the field. By
playing with four defenders, there are not too many
occasions in which man-markers are left without
help either next to them or behind them.

Even before I joined Fred Schmalz’ staff at the
University of Evansville, I knew the reputation
that the Purple Aces had for being pretty staunch
defensively. The 1990 team that went to the Final
Four holds an NCAA record that quite well might
never be broken, having shut out 20 opponents
that season. They have played with both three
and four players at the back, but usually with four
defenders because of the cover it provides.

The sweeper

Playing with or without a sweeper should be based
on a team’s personnel. Whether you play with three
or four at the back, the type of cover you will get
for your man-markers will vary based on whether
you play flat at the back or with a sweeper.

With a sweeper behind two or three man-marking
defenders, it allows for deeper cover on balls
played over the top of your team’s defense. Having
said that, it also frequently allows attacking players
to run behind their defenders without the ball
and still remain onside. I stressed the athletic
dimensions of the sweeper when mentioning the
IU and FC Westchester teams earlier because if you
are going to play with a player that far behind his

2


_208 The Best of Soccer Journal_

man-markers, he or she had better be able to track
down any players running through there.

Cover at the back, as well as an organizing player
to essentially coach your other defenders, is
necessary for success. The main question with
using a sweeper is how deep that player positions
himself or herself behind the man-markers. The
exaggerated depth at times is easily noticed at the
youth level, where most high school and club teams
play in that fashion. In some ways, it becomes a
cop-out for a player who lacks confidence in his or
her ability to stay up behind their defenders and
still be able to cover balls played over the top of
them. Some use it to overcompensate for a lack of
foot speed, and believe that staying farther back
will allow them the extra time to get to some of
those balls played behind their defenders.

A different twist to the use of a “deep-lying
sweeper” was seen in a high school game recently.
That match was officiated with no linesmen and
two officials sharing the duties. With no linesmen
to stay in line with the last man at the back, both
teams played with deeper sweepers to compensate
for the official’s lack of coverage on the field. When
you play with your center backs right up behind
your man-markers, you are also at the linesmen’s
mercy to make sure that they are able to recognize
when an attacking player runs offside. With a
deeper central player behind their defense, they
take the linesman’s interpretation of offside out
of the equation in most cases. By playing in this
fashion, there are fewer times where players are
offside. When they are, it is usually blatantly obvious.

As I watch more youth players in this type of
alignment, they seem to be placing themselves in
unrealistic situations. Namely a lot of these deep-
lying sweepers are misplaying the position. When
they play the “real sweeper position” at the next
level, they have brought only the skill of covering
space to the position. At the college level, they will
find, especially on the men’s side where play is so
athletic and attack-oriented, that the sweeper’s

role is much more wide-ranging in scope. That’s
why you see so many of these youth sweepers
converted to marking backs or midfielders at the
next level, because they often need to play with
cover themselves.

The most ironic phrase in soccer is playing flat at
the back because you never really ask all three or
four players to play straight across the back with
each other. Essentially, playing with four defenders
across the back without a sweeper allows you to
use all four of those players to cover across the field
and maintain good shape at the back. This also
allows for each man-marker to have cover nearby
that will make it easier to handle the player they
are defending (Diagram # 3).

By playing in this fashion, it also allows you to
defend with four players “passing on” one, two
or three forwards and lets you keep numerical
superiority over your opponents in your own
defensive third of the field. With so many teams
now using three forwards, this would not change
the shape of your team’s defense.

The biggest problem with the defensive
development of youth players is that coaches are
stressing rigid “systems” rather than teaching
them the principles of play. At a recent youth
tournament with age levels ranging from U-9 to

3


_To Sweep or Not to Sweep..._

_Techniques  Tactics 209_

U-17, I noted how deficient young players were
at individual defending. Some coaches spend so
much time teaching players Coerver-type attacking
moves and encouraging them to take defenders
on, that perhaps they have been remiss in teaching
defenders how to react to these actions.

Rather than have youth teams playing sweepers in
the current fashion (providing deep cover), why not
encourage them to man-mark an opponent without
that false sense of security? In this manner, our
youth players will acquire collective defensive skills
such as keeping attacking players in front of them,
as well as learn individually how to close these
players down once they have the ball.

As to whether to play with a sweeper or not, I don’t
know if there is one answer. Each coach having

different players at his or her disposal would have
to make that a case-by-case decision. What I do
know is that the best defenders at the college and
professional levels seem to have been exposed to
playing with both three and four at the back, and
with both a sweeper and flat at the youth levels. By
exposing your players to these different tactics, you
are providing them with a more realistic playing
environment, one that will develop them into more
versatile and well-rounded players.
